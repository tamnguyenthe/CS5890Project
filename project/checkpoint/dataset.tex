\section{The dataset}
As mentioned in the proposal. The dataset consists of 4040 requests collected from the Reddit community Random Acts of Pizza between December 8, 2010 and September 29, 2013. Each data object is a request for a free pizza. There are 994 requests received a pizza while 3046 requests did not. We converted the dataset from JSON into data frames in \texttt{R}, each row in a data frame represents a request while each column represents an attribute. Attributes include information about requests such as id, text, requester name, etc. and meta-data such as: time of the request, activity of the requester, community-age of the requester, etc. We removed fields that contain values collected after the time a request was posted. Table \ref{fields} shows important attributes (and explanations that) we consider in our analysis.
