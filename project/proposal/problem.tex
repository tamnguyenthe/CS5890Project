\section{The problems}

Internet is a newly discover virtual land, where humans interact with each others on multiple levels. Interaction with a new person on-line is only a few mouse clicks away. It is an active researching field to study the interaction between humans in a virtual space. Study how human response to request from a complete stranger is an interesting research question. Crown-funding has been one of the best way for startup companies and inventors to acquire necessary funding.\\

Althoff \emph{et al} have investigate which factors effect the successfulness of a request \cite{tim14}, specifically requests for free pizzas. They used topic modeling and logistic regression to determine which narrative topic have the highest success rate and in turn determine factors that effect the outcome of a request such as: who is asking, how the request was asked. We decided to extend this research by using a different set of techniques that are more up-to-date such as distributed vector representation (Word2Vec\cite{word2vec}) and Support Vector Machine. We will discuss the details of our plan in The plan section.\\
