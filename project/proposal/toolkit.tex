\section{The Toolkits}
We plan to use \texttt{R} as the main programming language in our analysis. We have used \texttt{jsonlite} library for importing dataset (in \texttt{JSON} format) to dataframe in \texttt{R}. We also used \texttt{R} to produce boxplots in our preliminary analysis. All attributes about requester are quantitative, thus, using \texttt{R} as the analysis language is sufficient. For analyzing textual data, we plan to use \texttt{word2vec} library\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/}}. For building classifier to predict whether a request receive a pizza we plan to use \texttt{R} interface of \texttt{libsvm}\footnote{\url{https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/}} library.
