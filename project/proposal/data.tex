\section{The dataset}
We downloaded data from Kaggle\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza/download/train.json.zip}}. The dataset includes 4040 requests collected from the Reddit community Random Acts of Pizza between December 8, 2010 and September 29, 2013. Each data object is a request for a free pizza. There are 994 requests received a pizza while 3046 requests did not. \\

The dataset is in \texttt{JSON} format. Each \texttt{JSON} entry represents one pizza request. Data fields includes information about requests such as id, text, requester name, etc. and meta-data such as: time of the request, activity of the requester, community-age of the requester, etc. There are several fields are collected after the time a request was posted, the values of those fields doesn't affect whether a request receive pizza, thus, we removed those fields out of the dataset. Table \ref{fields} shows important attributes (and explanations that) we consider in our analysis.
