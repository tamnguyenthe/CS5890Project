[] old friend coming to visit. would love to feed her some dinner. indiana. hey guys:
 i love this sub. i think it's great. (except the sob stories. i miss when this place was fun!) anywho, i've given a pizza out before so thought i would try my luck at getting one. my friend, who lives an hour away and our schedules do not let us see each other too much, decided to come down and visit me for the night! i would love to be able to be a good host and order her a pizza to go with some beer!

again, no sob story. just looking to share a pizza with an old friend :)

[] help me give back to my roomies on friday. we're in tampa florida...moving to ybor on friday. my email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since i'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.


my two roommates and i have found a new place to live and are moving in on friday. the rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. my 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until i have a job. i am so thankful to have them as friends! this month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). we also had to pay $310 for teco to turn on the electricity.


i would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. my one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. using a few coupons, i can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from pizza hut. if anyone can help me out i would be so grateful! pizza hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. i have an interview on thursday so keep your fingers crossed!

[] just got back from a job interview they never told me was cancelled. been looking for work for 2 weeks since moving back to my hometown.. haven't had a paycheque for 2 months. finally get a lead, two phone interviews, and an interview scheduled for today. i get in there, and the hr manager explains that they "tried to reach me yesterday" to tell me not to come in. unfortunately they did not email nor did i have a message on my phone from them, so i just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview i showed up for and didn't even fucking get.

pizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point. moreso i'm just really, really hungry and haven't been able to eat well lately. the friends i'm staying with give me a bite here and there, but they're very low income with 3 kids and i try to avoid it at all costs. would seriously appreciate it, and pay it forward!
[] i can't draw for my life, but i'd love a pizza!. i can't draw.. at all but i'd really love a pizza for me and my roommate tonight and i thought i'd try and cheer him up with some since he is pretty down today. i can try and draw you something in ms paint? i don't have kittens or cute cat pictures i can show so sorry to dissapoint :(
[] broke college students stricken with a sickness the munchies. . we're a group of 4 college students, who don't have enough money collectively to buy ourselves a pizza, so we thought we may leave it to the raop gods (or goddesses) to decide whether or not we're meant to have this pizza. we live in central california, and would very much appreciate a delicious pizza! 

[] maryland. i hope i'm doing this right. i waited before posting, because i thought i would have money for food tonight. i tried selling some textbooks on craigslist, but the person who wanted to buy them never showed up. the money i was going to get from my textbooks was going to be used for food for the week. i am completely out of food and very hungry. one pizza would be enough to get me through tonight, and hopefully i'll be able to get these books sold tomorrow.

[] 17-year-old, broke, could use some comfort food ;~;. hiya~

this isn't my main account, but i have some friends from real-life who know my main, and i want to keep this private. i'm using an old throwaway, as i figured it might help to prove a little bit that i really *am* an active reditor. (promise! :3) i used this throwaway to publish a story to /r/nosleep that got a fair amount of attention. (check it out if you're interested.)

anyway, i was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past week, and my family doesn't even get it. they just say that i'm screwing up and i feel like i can't take it anymore. (╥﹏╥)

some comfort food would be really nice, if some kind person (≥\^.\^≤) might be willing to buy me a pizza, to go along with my movie. i'll even write you a story about something you choose, if you want.

thanks!~

**edit**: oh, and fyi, i've never received pizza on my main account either. o.o

[] arizona usa not a dollar to my name, but willing to trade some of my mad beading skills for some dinner for my family. edit: user iamseth saved the day!!! thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/

it's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22m) and i (23f).  he is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and i am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  i spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our m-power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in phoenix arizona) to no avail : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  so we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  my boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  we could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  there are no groceries here, i actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  a pizza hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  i do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and i will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  

in exchange for any help someone can give i would like to make you a small beaded item.  i could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads i have here.  you could tell me what colors you like and i could make something for you or a loved one.  i am open to suggestions.  included are examples of what i can do.

[]pay day is tomorrow no money or food today (redmond wa.). i keep seeing these videos popping up on youtube. you know the one's with the really depressing music and the guy sitting in a dark room holding up signs. i figured why not try it out and see if someone is generous enough to reward my starving roommates (brother and his gf) and i with some pizza. i would put more info about our situation but i will let the depressing video do the talking for me.

[] san jose, california - americorps alumni and severely underemployed teacher out of food and would be ecstatic if there was some pizza in her life right now. hey raop,

my situation is that i just finished a term in americorps (http://www.reddit.com/r/americorps) now i'm looking for work and picked up a class to teach at a college, but it doesn't even cover my rent so i'm still looking for a full-time job.

i ran out of food this month because i was sharing my food stamps with another americorps to tide him over (he's a wiry guy that ate like a horse, and i'm just a wee 120 lb gal that doesn't need that much, so it made sense at the time).  i'm down to 5 packets of ramen, but new funds come in on the 5th so i really just would like to get through this weekend and also feel a bit less depressed while job hunting and lesson planning.  if you could please send me a pizza, it would make my night!

thank you.  hopefully someday soon i'll be the one sending out the pizza.

i live in austin, texas. this is a throwaway account because i know people from real life on reddit. i have been having a lot of financial trouble and i barely have enough to feed the kids, the wife and me. i have no problem letting the kids and wife eat over me but the thing is we barely have enough money to feed the kids an pay the bills. after i get done paying the bills i only have about 20 bucks to feed my family. i go to the dollar store and buy them some food but they are getting tired of eating the food from there. i would be so happy if someone were to give us a pizza and would gladly repay you when i get back on my feet. i'm at work right now but i'm doing this now because i don't want the kids to tell me how they want to eat something else. i live in austin,texas and if you read this thank you for taking the time to read my plea.

i'm sure people frequently say "oooh get me pizza and i'll get you back sometime pinky promise" and then never cash in on that promise. well i won't lie. i'm pretty broke, and until august when new job starts, i can't promise i'll get you guys back. so no empty promises for now. but i can tell you guys i'm hungry and broke, and it would be amazing if any of you could help me. 

thank you
[] (us) i will trade you a lovely homemade scarf, the first one i've ever made or a new one, for delicious pizza. also i will draw you a narwhal.. edit- fulfilled! awesomely!

i'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. this is terrifying. pizza (and maybe a salad, so i don't feel godawful fat. just a pizza is dandy too) would help calm my nerves. alas, i have no spare money. so, i am proposing a magnificent trade- i will finish the scarf that i just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off now, because i already have drawings of those. both are pretty awesome.

[half-finished scarf](http://i.imgur.com/c1gax.jpg)
(i'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. right now it's just about exactly two feet. full disclosure, i did learn to crochet right before i started it, so the beginning isn't great. if you're willing to wait a week or two, i can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. in that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. i can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. stripes are way better. anyway. those are your options. i could totally do a bitchin' slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black/silver/gray one, or... your options are endless)

[] i need help!i know i'm a loser but i have no where else to turn!. dear reddit:

i am a long time follower but have only recently just registered. a long story short is i am fucked!!! i am a 30 year old male from st.catharines, ontario (neil peart, linda evangelista, paul bernardo, karla homolka, dave thomas (sctv), alexisonfire, the trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! i have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up i'm homeless and though i have $40 on me i  want to save it incase i need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.

a little back story here, as i feel it's needed to shed some light as how i got to this point; when i moved into this place i was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after i moved here. not to worry i quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called ccsi which had a contract to clean the new food classics plant here in st.catharines. i have worked since i was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so i took first job i could get.

the job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. my very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so i would have to do the training in a few days... i didn't get training until after i called ministry of labor (ontario) which was after i was already injured, but i i'll speak about this later.
 
i did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.

while working there i requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. not wanting to be a bitch i kept working despite my concerns.

fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from cfia (canadian food inspection agency)so everything has to be tip top. one of the duties when cfia comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).

while i was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, i spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. afterwards i couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift i couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. i tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point i couldn't sleep. i then called telehealth and they advised i go to a walk in clinic.

there i was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, i think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. i did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,

a month later im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which i hadnt done since injury and i get x-rays. doctor at hospital i need to see family doctor and have mri.

see family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for mri. mri results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. prognosis: no bending, no lifting, no twisting... for life!

july 4th i see a neurologist for an emg to determine whether i have back surgery but i have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.

oh and because wsib says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, i am all better, i have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (june 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side i do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!

can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? 

i can prove anything i just dont have a scanner so i would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.

i'm a big fan of dominos, but obviously, anything would be more than appreciated.

also, when school's out and i'm back home, it will be easier to come by money and i would love to return the favor.

i was coming down a one way street with the right of way and no stop sign/light. he blew thru a stop sign and t-boned me. before i even got out of my car to start dealing with everything he fled the scene leaving his friend behind in the passenger seat. this guy was visibly drunk and acted as if nothing happened. he fled 20 min after it happened.

i don't get paid until the end of the month but will pay forward as soon as i get my paycheck.

tl;dr drunk drivers suck
:just need someone to call in my order.. dropped my phone in the mop bucket today and the only number i remember is not around
[] just moved to eastside wa, brought wife, found job. dinner would make the move complete.. hi raop redditors,

i recently moved up to kirkland, wa, and due to less than happy circumstances had to move my wife up when our finances were less than ideal in order to get her out of them. while the hope was to move her up when our finances were more stable, it just didn't pan out that way.

the good news is that it meant i got to be with her sooner. the bad news is that it's meant having no money for much food at all - in fact, we ran out of food this evening. we're waiting on some sales on craigslist to get through and see us through the weekend, but it doesn't look like those will happen tonight.

i would be deeply grateful if the pizza fairy made its visit tonight, and so here is my story. thank you.

[] broke chick in metro detroit area just ate the last of the edibles from the refrigerator for lunch today. would love a pizza for dinner and lunches for the next couple of days.  . i don't get paid for several days and my grocery money had to be used for my gas tank, and to me, my gas tank takes priority (so i can get to work to make money to buy food). anything would be welcome but preferences are jet's or pizza hut. be kind. i will be paying it forward when i do get paid.
[] tucson az, usa.  spent all our grocery money on the vet bill. our rabbit, bugs got sick.  he lost 30% of his body weight and as a result his temperature also dropped a whopping 8 degrees f below normal.


we spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, critical care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  i also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, i basically just get work whenever i tell my boss i'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and sunday.  my boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and i've missed school so i'm also way behind.



he needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  he's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  his mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  this is taking every bit of our energy.



if he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of critical care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  the estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.




so, if you've made it this far, i'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from pizza hut, dominoes, or black jack (those are the closest places to us).  if you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too/instead.  anything to keep us from ramen would be so appreciated.




**tl;dr** our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  this was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24/7 monitoring.  the vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  after we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.  pizza wold be wonderful.

[] burlington, vt college ra in need of a pie. hey reddit! i'm an ra at one of the colleges in burlington, vt. i have an event with my dorm tonight, and unfortunately i'm a little low on cash. my plan was to get some residents together, do some team building activities, and then play apples to apples to blow off some steam from midterms.

sadly, i usually need some form of food to help lure these kids in to take part in my reindeer games. since i'm low on money until payday on friday, i was hoping one of you lovely people could spot me a pizza. it's a small dorm, and anything would help. i'm not sure how promising to repay a pizza works here, but i'll hit you back with some money to one of "the big three" whenever you need it :]

help some hungry college kids out, please?

[] broke, alone, and hungry. hey guys,

i'm a student at a pretty good university where most students are pretty financially stable. unfortunately, that's not the case for me. i get some scholarships that help a lot, but thanks to some discrepancies i won't see any money for a couple of days. my mother is a single mom going through some financial issues because of some hospital bills and i can't bear to ask her for some cash and burden her further. so i'm turning to this subreddit in hopes of getting some warm food for tonight.

if by some random chance of fortune someone throws some food my way i'll be sure to return the favor once my scholarship money clears through.

thanks guys

[] graduated in may, haven't been able to catch a break since. hey reddit,

i'm a recent college grad from virgina tech, go hokies, with a degree in accounting.  i'm currently sitting on almost $35000 in debt, and i don't know what to do.  i just checked my account and discovered i have $200 to my name. my rent is $950, all my bills are due and despite having sent out nearly 300 resumes in the past two months, i don't have a line on anything.

i'm not one to beg or look for handouts, but i'm sitting here, constantly refreshing my inbox and monster.com, hoping and praying for some kind of job offer, and have decided to swallow my pride for at least the afternoon and see if this community's good heart and generosity would give me a helping hand.

i wish i could have come here on different terms, with me giving out free pizzas, but i swear as soon as i'm on my feet, i will return the favor for someone else in need.

[] pizza for a very pregnant and crabby friend of mine.. she's very crabby, very pregnant and all she wants is pizza. she's got two 5 year olds (twins) and a husband, but he doesn't get paid until next week.

thanks guys!

[] sounds so yummy, but too expensive for us when the belt it as tight as is it right now!. i am usually the one who gives, but unfortunately like so many others in this economy my family and i have fallen on hard times and would love the special treat of a pizza for dinner. we would be so greatful and appreciate it so very much. i was always taught to give back what god gives you and i would look forward to returning the favor when the clouds part and the sun shines upon us again. god bless!
[] (ri) started a new strenuous job and would love a pizza for myself + supportive lovers. firstly thanks raop for existing. i love reading other people's pizza'd experience. 

i started a new job as a baker for stop n shop after not having a steady one for the past three years. i absolutely love working due to my natural high energy level, so it's awesome! however my body is adjusting to the activity level which is one of the highest in my life - i also dance daily since i found rhythmic movement is necessary for me to regulate my emotions and impulses. however since i'm broke due to screwing up my landlady's dirt patch and rent being due, i'm on the beans/ramen/seitan diet which i don't actually mind at all except i dropped six pounds in the past week and every muscle in my body hurts in a new way. i can't afford used clothes from the thrift store anytime this month unless i get birthday money, can't afford to take the bus home, and i don't get paid til thursday. 

the pizza wouldn't just be for me. fortunately i live with two wonderful supportive lovers (closed poly triad). my bf helped me out giving me a lift home a couple times because cars beep at me and people yell stuff while walk home from work exhausted :( our gf is in chronic pain and feeling depressed due to trying to be a bio major after going through two windshields and injuring her ankle bad on the job when i met her. i would love to cheer her up with cheesy goodness, since they are also broke.

thanks raop!
[]what's a fella have to do to get a pizza around here?. **warning:** *this may be cheesy.*
   
i would sure love a pizza  
the problem is, i'm broke  
i would use 420 as a reason  
but i cant, cause i don't toke  

my mouth is a' watering  
just typing this freakin poem  
sauce and cheese and cheese and sauce  
and mountain dew a flowin'  

oh how i could only hope  
to burn my lips tonight  
on a steaming melty greasy peice  
of a glorious pizza pie  

im not here to look for pity  
but on this poem i must amend  
i felt like a baller on last friday  
but im counting change this weekend  

the food in the fridge is old and moldy  
even though once it was hoarded wealth  
i would clean it out but i cant  
'cause it would be hazardous to my health  

basically what im saying is  
i love pizza more than life  
and i would love to take you guys up  
if someone's a' offerin' a slice  

*seriously though, you guys are awesome. i love reddit.*

[] a pizza for a recent, unemployed college grad in missouri. hey raop! i am currently unemployed and just graduate from missouri state with a degree in journalism. life's been hard recently and i only have 60 bucks to spend over the next 2 1/2 weeks. my food stamps ran out and i cannot get back on the for another 3 weeks. 

i would love a pizza, because as of late, i have been eating one package of ramen a day. i am about to go to the store to get my dog some more food, and probably will only have 45 dollars left after that. 

my parents are in a similar situation and really cannot help me. i have never been in such a poor situation my entire life, and some pizza would definitely make my situation a lot more tolerable!

[] brother tried to kill himself and i can't even afford to drive home to visit him in the institution.. don't know where to start. my brother tried to commit suicide last tuesday by oding on the antidepressants he was just given by his psychologist.

i live about 300 miles away from home with my girlfriend currently. i only have intermittent part time work and just visited last weekend, so i'm too broke to go home again right away.

it hurts so bad thinking of him locked up in the facility, though my family can visit him 1 hour a day, and i call every day right after they're through to check up on him. sounds like they've got him diagnosed but we have no idea when he's getting out.

this is half just to vent, i guess. nothing is fun right now. i'm completely disinterested in my hobbies.

i know it's unreasonable, but i feel guilty when i'm having fun because i know he can't.

i wish someone could send him a pizza.

[] would love to have some pizza please akron, oh usa. i didn't know there was a place on the internet where you could even make a request like this. reddit is truly amazing and the people here are so nice. i find myself getting lost in threads, especially about memes, iama, and askreddit. i have to admit, i browse more than i make actual responses because i usually don't have the time to sit down and type out a response.           

so today i find myself with nothing important to do. i slept in, cleaned up the place, went for a walk and came back with nothing to do. even the programs on tv aren't that entertaining. i have a choice between keeping up with the kardashians and pregnant and dating. no thank you. i think i'll keep the tv off for now.         

i would greatly appreciate something random and delicious, since my saturday has been pretty ho hum so far.  nothing fancy, but i would totally dig a cheese pizza. i would be so grateful if someone would be willing to treat me to some pizza tonight. thank you.

[]. honestly, i dont know what to put here. im not preggos, i have no shitty roommate. i live with my girlfriend and my 2 cats. ive been unemployed for 3 years and im not on any kind of "benefits". usually, i dont like asking for help like this, but unfortunately i have nothing for us to eat tonight except for a quarter box of cinnamon toast crunch. while normally, this would be totally awesome, we have done nothing but eat ctc for the last 2 days. im at the point where im down to trade for a pizza or two. i attend comic-con every year and i do have some spare memorabilia ive gotten in years past. i would totally be willing to trade somebody some comic-con swag for some food. thanks for reading.  oh, i live in orange county california, fyi. thanks again.

:edit:awesome! got a pizza tonight from "truongbv" saved the day!

no sad story, just want some pizza
() no sob story, no starving children, just a hard working guy down on his luck. west palm beach, fl. hey everybody,

i've read through a lot of these requests, and there are a lot of people much worse off than i, so if it comes down to it, i hope they get help first.

that being said, i would be extremely grateful if someone would be willing to help me out.  like i said, i don't have a sob story, no little children's mouth's to feed, but i'm kind of stuck in a rut in life, and i think pizza might cheer me up.

it's wing wednesday at pizza hut, and i couldn't tell you the last time i didn't have a meal that wasn't prepared out of a plastic bowl or metal cup.  if someone had it in their heart, and wanted to help me out, i would be forever grateful.

thanks

[] (toronto, canada) just a hungry university student sitting in a giant mess of clothes, books and papers, studying for an optics test. it's sad i know. i really dislike optics but it's one of those courses i have to take to graduate (computer engineering), kind of irrelevant for the field i want to go into. i will be forever grateful to whoever the mystery-pizza-sender is and will pass on the random-act-of-kindness to another stranger in some way or another.

[] crappy day in ocean city, nj. of all the forums i've seen on here, this one is the most interesting, most interactive, and the most uplifting. 

need some of that right about now. i think i sprained my ankle because i was scared i was going to be late to work. i was three minutes early. then i got laid off.
my wife has a reliable job, but it's only meant for secondary income. grocery day is on friday, but we have to start cutting back and saving as soon as we can. we probably won't have pizza for a while so if anyone can help us and the kids out, it'd be great. i can't promise to pay it back on a certain day, but i will do it as soon as i can.

off to the fun world of resume writing....

thank you all for doing what you do and for reading my post!

[] mozzarella, melting all over bubbling, savory tomato sauce. a perfect, light brown crust... yes, yes, yes!!!. i'll spare you my sob story. pizza would be indescribably awesome! this is my first time asking and i'll definitely pay it forward.

edit: f5, don't fail me now! if you can beat the crap out of the reddit alien, surely you can help  make some pizza magic!

edit2: i would walk 500 miles and i would walk 500 more just to *be* the man whose pizza gets delivered to his door.

edit3: mediocre, random, boredom and hunger-inspired fact: one of my highest scoring posts ever was a video on how to fold a fitted sheet.

edit4: i used to be a delivery guy. cheesesteaks. on a very regular basis, customers would take several minutes to answer the door, yelling "hold on!!!" open it, huffing and puffing, sweat rolling down their faces and half naked bodies. they were usually about as attractive as you'd imagine chronic cheesesteak takeout-orderers would be.

[] due to poor decision making i had to move back in with my parents at 24. i want a damn pizza.. i quit my job to go abroad for 30 days.  not the best decision of my life, but i would never get the opportunity to take a trip like i did again.  while i was gone, due to circumstances outside my control, i lost my apartment.  so, i come back after 30 days to no job and no place to live.  my roommate was kind enough to start packing for me after he had packed his own things.

now i'm here, living with my parents who can't afford to take me in.  i've just got a job (i made seven dollars yesterday! yay!) but, can't really afford to spend anything on anything extra.  i'd really just like a pizza.

[uk ] its 9:30am, my house, wallet and stomach are empty :(. i read about this website a while ago and had a little read through it, but never had the need to register. anyway, the time has come for me to make a post.

i just moved into a small new flat with my mum, after my brother died recently and she couldn't afford to keep paying the mortgage for our old house. everything is pretty much still in boxes and all the cupboards are empty, so my mum has been leaving me money or a sandwich from tesco or something to keep me going. we had an argument last night because she was drunk and she promised she would stop drinking, and when i woke up this morning she hadn't left any money or food, so i have nothing to eat all day long. i have no money (the wallet was a figure of speech - i don't have a wallet!) at all, not even £1 to go and get something cheap from tesco. i woke up early this morning due to being hungry.

i am embarrassed to post on here so i hope i haven't done this in vain, someone please help me out. thank you in advance.

p.s. i'm in the uk

[] hungry university student tucson, az. i've been down on my luck lately. i have a job but i just can't get hours :&lt; (i'm trying to get a different job right now) not to mention that they didn't even pay me for my work last week (i've talked to them about it and i'm waiting for my paycheck but who knows when that will show up).  i did get a check to help pay for food from a non profit group my mom deals with but i was stupid and didn't cash it but deposited it. so i may be able to use it tuesday or so but i'm running out of food. overall i would love a pizza to nibble on for the next couple of days. i also do plan on helping people out here once my financial situation is all settled :3
[] death is certain, life is not.  help keep me alive! hooah!. hello, 
30 year old from tx panhandle area
so anyway, i'm struggling! i live in a rural community with hardly any jobs or places to work, and i work online the best i can on surveys and writing articles etc.  i am a remote pc technician and have lots of experience with it/tech field, but no clients in this area.   i haven't ate for almost 3 days and haven't smoked cigarettes either, because i can't afford them, and actually feel a little better, i just have periods where i want to hulk smash everything in my apartment!  i do however have 7mg patches that i acquired from the va administration.  yes i'm a veteran, but do you really think just because you signed a contract with the federal government they are going to take care of you for the rest of your life? no.  people that deserve disability have to fight for years to get more percentage of benefits and it's hard.  i am on hud but there is no income.  i offer my services for pizza or paypal  i can remote in to your desktop or laptop pc only, screw apple!! and optimize and speed up your system.  no files will be viewed including photos and documents.  you can sit in front of the computer and end the connection at any time.  will update and make sure you have proper protection and use the latest greatest software downloaded and installed right in front of your eyes.   i can not remote in without a unique identifier and cannot do it again without authorization from you.  services like this from major corporations can cost up to $200 dollars just for the same thing i offer and will accept pizza or donations.  ]
     today i mowed a large area with someone i know to try and get money, yet that small amount of money is being saved so i can pay my late fees and rent that is accruing which is $100.  since i haven't ate in a while i got very dizzy and lightheaded and heat exhaustion,  i am recovering from the heat, but hunger has set in.  if i violated anything i'm sorry, this is my first time on here i was referred by an online friend. thank you for reading and your time!!!

[] i'm hungry in florida! (and just realized how many food related incidents i've had today). i haven't eaten all day (except for muh cereal, but it was the nock of publix brand chereioes. oh i also ate publix icecream, but someone left it was a milkshake. not to mention the fact that i dropped the container spilling i....)

wow i just realized how many food related accidents i've had today. anyways i dropped the container and spilt melted icecream all over the kitchen floor. but at that point i didn't care because my bagel was done. it burned in the toaster. hurt but not knocked down i scraped the black off the bagel and put some delicious salmon cream cheese on it (if you don't have salmon cream cheese get some it sounds extremely gross, but is actually pretty decent). finally my little brother (14) tried to snatch my bagel out of my hands. he knocked it into the air luckily i bobbled it enough to regain control of my delicious snack. unfortunately, i also bobbled cream cheese all over my arms and face. but fear not! i took revenge by sneaking up on him from behind and slapping a large amount of cream cheese on his face (the good kind).

yeah. that was my day today (not to mention all the college apps i did). this is why i deserve a mushroom pizza. cheers.
[] i feel really embarrassed asking but i'm completely out of money and my fridge is bare. hastings, england. . so, i [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lsqto/i_would_like_to_take_a_moment_to_rant_about/) a week or so ago about the problems i was having getting the student finance company to get my loan to me, and it still hasn't been resolved and i've reached the end of my overdraft (they'll only give me a £200 overdraft until my loan comes through). i tried to go to my university to get some emergency funds and the lady i spoke to said i could only get a £50 bridging loan which seeing as i'd have to pay back in 4 weeks she didn't want to give me. and after arguing with her for quite a while about how i needed the money to buy food she said that it didn't matter because the lady who could've given me the money left at 2pm (i went in at 1:30pm, she was just arguing with me for that long). 

i then went into my bank to try and get my overdraft extended and they told me i needed to do it over the phone, went home and called them up and apparently i needed to go back to my branch and do it. and it would be shut by the time i went in again today.... 

so could anyone possibly send me a pizza or like... any other food? i haven't eaten all day :( 
[] would really appreciate a pizza tonight in pennsylvania. i have been on food stamps for about the past 10 months because my job only pays a small living stipend, but my food stamps were cancelled last month. they were cancelled when my phone number changed and i didn't convey this information to the correct person at the welfare office apparently. anyway, i have been working to get them back but it takes forever and needless to say i have been kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel, food-wise lately. 

i would really appreciate a pizza and will definitely pay it forward as soon as i get everything sorted out. fingers crossed i will be getting a job with a full salary soon anyway!
 killeen texas usa. i am retired army and a disabled veteran and i also have a cleaning business. right now contracts are very low and so my income has dropped. the cost of the business has started eating into my personal funds and until contracts increase i'm living day to day. i have 1 bag of beans left on the shelf and the food pantry is closed for the weekend as a matter of fact it's closed monday also. i work hard and that won't stop because i enjoy what i do, i'm just stuck and asking for a little help to keep my family fed and i hope to be able to help someone else in the future :)

[] pizza for daughter's birthday party.. let me start by saying that this site is incredible.  first of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  that's just magical.  the other side of that is while i'm not glad to know there are others going through what i'm going through, i am glad to know that i'm not alone.  i think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  you look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  some people make life look so easy.  i haven't know easy in a long time.  there's a sheryl crow song that goes, "no one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard."  i hear that in my head a lot.  i'm not looking for easy, i just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.  

i will say this though.  today has been an amazing day.  i came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  i can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  this is a feeling that everyone should know.  

my husband died a little over a year ago.  i have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  in january i went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that i could have a steady future.  i can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  it's going well though, and i'm excited for the future.  

we are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  my daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and i'm having a small party for her at our home.  it has a modest budget, and i've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  what i'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  it's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that i'm not in a position to really splurge on.  
i'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.

thank you.

[] [michigan] we just spent over $2000 in medical bills for our big fluffy cat's surgery, and don't have time to cook because we need to make sure she doesn't bite at her incision. . her name is chinadoll and she apparently had an enormous hairball stuck in her intestines.  we had taken her to the emergency vet clinic and they did a bunch of tests on her and all of them were really expensive, and then they told us that she would need surgery (which was $2000).  she is home and getting back to being her usual rambunctious self, but of course she should be lying down and recuperating.  we're all dead tired due to sleepless nights of waiting around at the clinic and worrying about her, of course, and could really go for some pizza.

as for the story behind chinadoll, she is a huge, fluffy, grey cat.  she is sometimes very sweet and loving but usually cruel, stubborn, and dominating.  she is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  she has been described as a "probability cloud of evil".  as a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  my so and i love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.

if you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like cottage inn.  other pizza places would be fine, though.  an e-gift card would be the best for this, i think.

here are some photos of chinadoll: http://imgur.com/a/amkc6

[]chicago, il - thanksgiving dinner is looking like ramen. unemployed and very hungry.. hey all, i am in a real rough patch. hopefully for only another week or two. basically my story is i was laid off a month and a half ago. i had a little bit of cash and my unemployment so everything was looking not great but at least ok. well an employer from last fall is contesting the fact that they should have to contribute to my unemployment. i had the phone hearing, i know i am in the right, i got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. but until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld. it has been 2 weeks now, well 3 unemployment checks. i have been steadily looking for work. my phone got shut off the other day and i had to use $80 of my last $100 to pay it so i can receive phone interviews. 

i bought some ramen and have been eating it for most of my meals for the past week now, my thanksgiving dinner looks like more of the same.  i would really like some protein, something tasty and feel full again after a meal.

i live in chicago, il which has a million and a half great pizza joints but i am by no means picky, just hungry. could anyone help a guy out? once i find a job and back on my feet i would be more than happy to "pizza it forward" or pay you back. thanks reddit.

[] pizza for my parents and brothers in nj. hello!

i'm riley and i'm requesting pizza for my family.  it'd sure be swell if someone could help us out. we aren't totally starving, but it sure would be a treat. i'm a senior in high school and i work part-time at a grocer. i have 3 little brothers. conner is 14 and the twins, ryan and brando,n are 10. i don't know when my mom was diagnosed with ms, but she worked every day until recently. my dad is a carpenter, but was laid off and has been doing wallpaper for a year now.

i'm going to college next year (don't know where yet) so i can get a good job and take care of my family. they deserve it. i pitch it where i can, but most of my money is going to car insurance right now. 

we're managing over here, but it'd be so great if someone could help get us even just a pizza. my parents do a lot for me and helping them with one meal would make a big difference.

thank you for taking this time to read this.

p.s. no i'm not cutting school; i'm on my friends computer during study.

i'm really sorry if i replied to everyone a bunch of times. my computer is kinda old and slow and i'm not sure what happened

[]my sad story. okay, so i'm going to try to keep this short, and stay with me because it really is a series of slightly unrelated events that landed me in my situation. sometime on sunday, my xbox live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of xbox live points were charged to my debit card. i called xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as i realized. they said it would take 25 days, and i should contact my bank if i want a speedier return of my precious monies. they also said my xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.

today after work, i did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. the banker said, or so i thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. mission accomplished, i head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.   

i had my food items rounded up and checked out, when bam! my card was declined. okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. no worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an atm.  

maybe you see where this is going...  

om nom nom went the atm, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said "this is **our** card now, criminal."  

so that's it. no entertainment (by way of online video games), no food (by way of the cancelled card), and not even a way to get money (by way of the gluttonous automatic teller machine) until sometime tomorrow when i can physically walk into my bank and withdraw the cash from their electronic grasp. 
[] lcd pizzasystem. listening to 45:33, hence the title. anyone feeling particularly generous?
i can draw you a picture, or tell you a story, or anything really. i've won a few contests, but never received a pizza. my roommate and i would be super grateful, as we'll be up all night working on our script for a blaxploitation zombie comedy film (sure zombies are played out, but who cares). 

much love to you all and the community.
[] first paycheck (in a long time) is days away and a long-overdue pizza celebration is needed.. hey raop!

recently i found a new job after being laid off, i haven't had the ability to celebrate in proper fashion due to funds going towards keeping a roof over my head and electricity on. was wondering if you guys could help me celebrate with pizza?

i shall pizza it forward once i get my paycheck as a token of my gratitude! thanks!
[] was up all night with a feverish 7 year old, would love not to have to cook today. canada.. my little man was sick last night and we both got little to no sleep. his fever is finally breaking and his appetite is coming back. i asked him what he wanted to eat and he said either pizza or pogo's (corn dogs on a stick), neither of which are in my freezer. i am exhausted and if i didn't have to cook it'd be amazing, but i don't have the money to order out. 
[] recently homeless, broke-ass kid in bellingham, wa would love some pizza, sick of cheap mcdoubles. hi there awesome redditors!

i'm in need of food :( 

i have been living off mcdoubles since the 25th of last month when my rental company forced us out of our rental 5 days early. ramen and eggs are getting old, as well as dollar cheeseburgers. 

i would love a pizza to thank a dear friend of mine for the $20 loan to pay my virgin mobile bill, paying him back tomorrow after selling plasma. would be awesome to share. 

i could repay you in house cleaning if your in the area, or if you need a personal chef for a night, i have references! or i can draw you some awesomely cheesy artwork since i won't have cash to pay you back.

this is my first time posting in this sub, saw all the kindness and was really touched. faith in humanity can rest easy on this sub's shoulders. 

sorry for rambling, just remembered this sub and thought it was worth a shot! here's to hoping! have a fantastic day :3

[] hungry single mom in central pennsylvania. single mom in central pennsylvania looking for some help. i only have enough food in the house for my children. i don't have any money right now. i always make sure they have what they need, even if i have to go without. i am getting grocery money on friday. i would really appreciate a pizza to help lift my spirits. thank you for taking the time to read this.
[, cincinnati, oh] spent today fighting world hunger; now i'm hungry and broke.. i work as a fundraiser for a nonprofit, (thanks to some /gw posts made a while ago, i'd prefer not to say which), and our pay and our jobs are based on quotas. i'm on review, (meaning i have two days to get my average up, or i lose what is the best job i've ever had--i care so much about what i'm doing). additionally, partly because it's been so cold here, my average has been down--which means, so is my pay. i have about $30 in the bank to last me the two weeks until next payday, but i don't even have access to it, as it's sunday, and my atm card got stolen. i've been working all day for this non profit, (on my feet, outside), and i'm really hungry...i just ate my last two pieces of bread today. i'm applying for foodstamps tomorrow, but, obviously, that process takes a while. one pizza would give me two meals that i didn't have to wonder about. at this point, i'm just terrified of being overdrawn on my account again, bringin nothing to my boss's going away potluck tomorrow, and not being able to afford my $25 a week meds, (not having health insurance blows). the car i drive for my company is also breaking down, and a million other little things have gone wrong lately.
i have never asked anything of reddit, and i feel awful for typing out this sob story. i promise that as soon as my tax refund comes through or i get a decent paycheck, (about two weeks?), i will either pay you back or pay it forward to another redditor, whichever you prefer. my roommates are also in a bind right now, but have done there best to help me out when they could, so i'd love to be able to offer them a few slices as a thanks, and to ensure that they both eat, too. again, i'm sorry for bitching, i know i have it pretty good compared to most of the rest of the world, (a hint to the poverty-related nonprofit i work for), but i could really use some hot food and, even more so, a kind act. whether you can help or not, thank you for reading.

[] just found out about random acts of pizza. single mother raising 2 kids. indianapolis, in. life has been really tough for us over the past few months.  i finally finalized my divorce to my ex, who turned into an abusive alcoholic nightmare towards the end, and i couldn't be happier i'm away from him now.

i had a decent job as a nurse, but i was caught up in the downsizing at the hospital, and have been looking for a job for the past few months, without much luck.  

i haven't really been able to spoil my girls with anything in a long time, let alone a pizza, and i would be incredibly humbled and gracious if someone would be willing to help us out.

this is an amazing community, and i hope to be able to come back here soon on the other side, being able to give away some pizzas.

thanks everyone

[] anniversary dinner. columbus ohio. worst week of our lives. my husband and i have been struggling to make bills and feed ourselves for the few past months. this week in particular has gone extremely down hill. we've been sick, without air conditioning in 90 degree weather, power would have been shut off if it weren't for my mother and every little thing in between. today is our two year anniversary, and we are out of food and money until tomorrow. it would be nice to have some pizza for dinner if someone could help out.

also, we have no internet, so i'm using my phone. sorry if i'm slow to respond. :/ 

thank you in advance if anyone responds. we aren't the type of people who like asking for help, it just seemed like a special occasion.

[] salton city, ca; willing to do silly shenanigans for pizza. i just want a pizza :]
[] out of food, phone disconnected, no money until tomorrow... and my fudge recipe!. okey dokey... i requested a pizza yesterday on account of being out of food. i did ask kind of late and did not get said pizza, my bad. i did not, however, go to bed hungry. it dawned on me that i had all the stuff for vegan fudge, i'm not vegan, or vegetarian, but i am pretty clever. here's what i had for dinner. 
     3 cups sugar
     1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)
     2/3 cups of coco
what you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the "hard ball" test... what's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a tsp of vanilla and a half a stick of butter if you've got it (i made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). at this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... nuts, raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... ya know whatever, i like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when i have it. super easy!
     anyway, i would like to eat real food tonight so if you can help out shoot me an email. otherwise i'm eating fudge again. could be worse... thanks guys!

[] new jersey. could really use a pick-me-up pie.. everyone has their sob story, so here's mine. 

my boyfriend recently quit his job. he worked retail, and generally hated everything about it. he's wanted to be a programer for ages now and since he quit he's looking to actually do it. so, he's home all day and i'm the one working to support us. we recently applied to get snap assistance but haven't heard back yet.. so the fridge is getting empty to the point of silliness.

that being said, to add a little motivation i guess, if i manage to get a pie i'll build you a shrine  in my smp minecraft world. :d will provide pictures as well to prove it all.

(papa johns is the only chain store that is in my area, but there's a ton of little mom and pop stores that offer like $5 pies)
[] so hungry and in need of a pie. anyone out there willing to help?. asking for this favor so i can pass it along as well in the future. just really hungry and tired
[] virginia... spent my last $12 on cat food...my empty stomach lead me here. am i doing it right?
[]  please feed my friend and i.  very hungry. she is sick and we are having a shit week.  will post cat pics! rva. the last microwavable burrito was eaten last night :(  now there are only condiments.  between rent and medicine, there is no money left to buy food.  we feel pretty hopeless.  we will make a whole imgur album of her cute cats to thank you!  i love you, reddit!
[] broke, unemployed and in kc, mo. i've known about this lovely subreddit for a while, but always decided against actually posting a request because there are people in so much worse situations than i. but, at this point the new tab isn't quite so dire, sooo....

i don't want to whine or drag on. basically, i've been jobless for a few months now. my sister is my roommate; i'm basically crashing here, but have to be out next month, as she's apparently moving in with her boyfriend after that. no, i don't feel good about being a jobless layabout. i've been job hunting hard but nothing's been working out, and i can only really get around on foot.

anyway, so the only food i've had around here is potatoes. which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) it's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland. the aforementioned sister spends most of her time with her boyfriend; my parents dropped off the bag of potatoes a couple of weeks ago. i don't wanna complain or anything, it's good to have a place to stay (for now) and sustenance,  but... a pizza, of any kind or any place, would be so so rad. haven't pizza since july (my birthday.)

 i will of course pizza it forward immediately when i'm in a position to do so, this subreddit is such a wonderful thing and needs all the offerers it can get to keep it running.

hope i'm doing this right! thanks!

[] college students, no money in bank account, been eating ramen for a week. my girlfriend and i are college students, we manage to pay our few bills by donating plasma at a local biolife, unfortunately after our internet and cellular bills we are left with a very small amount of money to live off of and most of that money gets put toward gas to get us back and forth to our school, as well as toward dog food. 

at this point my bank account is overdrawn, i have my computer on craigslist to get a few extra bucks from (im an it major), and we are struggling to get by.  

i know this is a long shot but all i ask for is a pizza so that we can eat something other than noodles for the first time in almost a week. if any one would be willing to help out i would be so grateful.  the only problem is that it would have to be an in-store pickup, not delivery, because we live outside of the range of any of the major delivery shops.

[] even a small pizza would be nice.... down on my luck lately and no gas or money to do anything of importance (or fun) on the 4th. something simple as a pizza would really make my day. i've been a long time lurker and i don't really participate in commenting or posting but definitely could use some good luck.
[] north carolina, usa a pizza would help out a lot. this hurts my pride to beg like this, but the position i am in leaves me with few options and hungry. i have my daughter with me and i'm flat broke with not much food in the house besides a couple cans of black beans and peanut butter; nothing i'd constitute as a meal. to anyone that is feeling generous enough to send a pizza my way it would be appreciated beyond words. i thought this would be worth a shot. 
[] along with 6 of my buddies, 1 dog, and 1 rat,  i was kicked out of our home.. so, we are in terrassa, españa (spain). today we were woken up by police and forced to leave our home. we are activist organizers from france, spain, and the states. the reason we were kicked out was because we were squatting the derilict home. it made no difference, of course, that we were fixing the place up and providing a safe place for travelers, and others with no home, to sleep. 

no matter if you agree or disagree with our stance on property rights, pizza would go a really long way to making such a crummy day nicer. 

buenos dias.
[] will have no food on wednesday 9-12. washington state.. my boyfriend doesn't get paid until thursday, we can happily repay someone or something after then. we have a package of ramen for today, so i would prefer to have any donated food for tomorrow when we will have literally nothing, except 72 cents for cat food... because i'm not about to let her starve! 
anyway, i don't know much about these reddits but i thought i would give it a chance... i can message with you if you want. also, it doesn't need to be pizza... we just want something to eat... but we don't have any gas in the car. please help...
thank you for at least looking :)

edit: i can offer something, i can draw you a picture of anything you want, i can make you a necklace, take a photo, or any other artsy thing! =)
[] bronx, ny i'm so stoned, i don't have any money, please i just ate an avocado it was bad. i'm not getting any money until tmrw, i haven't eaten in a couple of days and then i had like ramen it obliterated my digestive tract. i would love some pizza
super high []. just came back from a festival with 2 zips of the blue dream.

needless to say, me and three of my friends are pretty fucking high.

any amount of pizza would probably be the most amazing thing that could happen right now.

i would also like to show these stoners the awesomeness that is reddit.

thanks &lt;3
[] broke miami college student pulling an all-nighter. i'm an fiu student with .30 cents in my bank account for the next week craving some pizza to munch on while i work my way through a twelve page paper. everything on campus where i could use my meal plan is closed. help a girl out?

[] i'm tired of these mother fucking eggs in my mother fucking fridge.. i'm not gonna lie, money is tight for just about everyone. my mother lost her second job a month or so ago. we've been fine but the fridge is usually close to empty. except lately its filled with eggs. literally three fucking cartons. i've been looking for a job for a while and finally got one. but i don't start work for about a month so i can't as of yet contribute to the household. so i beg of you reddit, please send me pizza because as good as eggs are, i fear i may soon suffer a heart attack or turn into an egg myself.
[] broke college student on break, lost job and place to live since semester ended =/. hello, i've been a longtime lurker on reddit and finally made an account a few weeks back.. since then my life has absolutely been turned upside down. 

after this semester [full time] at university i lost my job. i had barely paid off this semester via payment plan when i received the voicemail informing me i was no longer needed at work. 

the issues created by not having money for my bills and gas caused major problems with my parents, who had been letting me live at home this last semester on the condition i would finish my degree and sustain myself financially regarding everything but the roof over my head. needless to say, they do not really have the means to support another person and i left because of this strain.

i have been couch crashing this last week at a friends' with literally nothing to offer him (or his awesome, understanding roommates who i really just met) in return for their hospitality. a pizza!! =) to share with these great people would not only be the first whole meal i have had for a while, but it would go a long way towards making me feel a bit better about myself for actually contributing to this house a bit. the other folks here are all struggling students, and looking in the pantry all i'm seeing is ramen and potatoes (lol). 

thanks for putting up with this wall of text, i felt obligated to give the whole story! not sure of what evidence is necessary but needless to say if you ask for it i will provide. i hope i did this right (got a confirmation code as well if needed) but here goes heh. take care!

[] it's my husbands birthday and he just wants a pizza!. payday isn't til next week and when we couldn't get a pizza for my birthday a few days ago he scrapped together the money. now he is craving a stuffed crust pizza and i can't even scrape together the money to get it for him and the kids...my 10 year old has even offered her $2 she has :( help! please!

[] totally starving and broke. please come to my rescue.. my name is liz. i'm 22 and stuck in my food barren apartment with nothing but an empty wallet and a frown. i would sincerely appreciate any help in filling my tummy with some cheesy goodness. i wish i had a sad story to tell but to be honest i was at the philadelphia folk festival for the weekend and stupidly spent all my money, forgetting that my cabinets were empty back at home. now i'm sitting here, tummy grumblin, on the verge of a headache, hoping to god that someone will show me alittle empathy. thank you for your time and good day.

[] passed on $2-a-slice-tuesday due to lack of funds; now having severe gastrointestinal remorse. (sacramento, ca, us). local purveyor of pizza slices, [luigi's slice] (https://www.facebook.com/luigisfungarden), has $2 pepperoni and cheese slices on tuesdays. while i could have procured one of these, it would've left me flat broke for the rest of the week. last night, willpower was working overtime, and i pulled through.

... this morning, i just had a bowl of grape nuts — which i typically do enjoy — but for whatever reason, the image of luigi's perfectly spiced oregano-laden sauce stabbed my brain, and subsequently my gut, relentlessly.

today is $3 for any slice, and i feel my willpower waning hard. at this point, any pizza would suffice — it is merely convenient (and awesome) that the cheaper option is also among the best in the area.

any help to satisfy this pizza craving would be much appreciated, i promise to pay it forward (in-kind, to the extent i'm able) by next $2 tuesday!
[] : i'm 14 and just want some pizza. hi first time posting here , i'm extremely hungry right now haven't eaten much today except junk food because there isn't much food at home i like.

i have a decent amount of allergies one of them being soy sauce but my mom still made stir fry which has it in it , no she is not a horrible person i just don't like getting heartburn anymore so i generally don't eat it. fun fact : i am actually allergic to chicken but can eat it 'most of the time'. 

i am also transgender not really looking for sympathy but the bar on the right says to list my current situation i also love parkour that's about all there is to know i am asking for just a pepperoni pizza from papa john's.

if i messed up at all in here please correct me i read the right side bar a couple times but i feel like i am fucking up.

also my family is not poor feel free to give to someone else in actually need for the food i am just hungry and bored.
[] washington usa; it's a hot summer day, and a hot pizza would make this afternoon the best in a while.. i just got back from a vacation with my dad, and i get home to my mom's, and it turns out she's gone vegan. a nice pepperoni pizza would make not only my day, but my week, or even quite possibly my month. all the thanks in the world if you decide to help out. :)

[] london, uk. not getting paid this month, could really do with a pizza!. due to some error at work which was found too late for anything to be done about it, i won't be getting paid until mid january. naturally as well as all the christmas expenses, my car decided that this would be a good time to need repair work and everything else, so i'll be spending christmas here with the dog.

[] birthday pizza - ca, usa. hey guys, this is my first time posting on here. i've been following this subreddit for a while, and asking for a pizza never really came to mind. well my birthday is today, and normally i take myself somewhere to celebrate, but after recently paying my college tuition, i was left with [a little over a dollar](http://i.imgur.com/bnkd2.png) in my account. i'd really appreciate a raop. 

thanks :)

[] hungry couple in minneapolis. hello! normally we would never do this, but we (me and my girlfriend) were hoping someone might be nice enough to buy us a pizza tonight? 

normally we wouldn't be in such hard shape, but delays in receiving my paycheck and some crazy insane overdraft fees (thanks tcf!) have left us with a grand total of $2.50 between the two of us until sunday.

we promise to pay it forward to another needing person next week when we are finally in the black again. i can send you proof of that if you would like. i used a throw-away for this post, but i would have no problem verifying my identity to anyone gracious enough to help. 

so, if you might be interested in helping us out let me know. we will be browsing /r/aww in the mean time, keeping a smile on our face and positive attitude on this whole situation. thanks!

[] uk. three more long days until payday and a long night of packing!. would adore a pizza this evening, haven't had any lunch and i do not think i can face plain pasta or rice for the 4th day in a row.

i have exactly enough money for bus fare to work tomorrow and wednesday and that it, all my spending for the past 2 weeks has been calculated exactly so obviously no frivolous pizza buying! would love a pizza whilst i pack up my room tonight ready to move back home at the weekend.

[] orillia, on. canada. just hoping someone could help me out tonight with some pizza. money is tight, and food is low. i start a new job next week so i wanted something to celebrate with rather than soup and crackers again. thanks for your time and consideration.
[] lonely, unemployed college student with no money in the bank account.. not picky at all; anything is greatly appreciated.

[]  had a bad day, could use a reminder that life's okay. today has sucked a lot.  sitting alone in my apartment while my family goes on vacation - i need to stay available in case i need to go in for a second job interview, so i couldn't go.

money's been tight.  i got netflix recently and the free month just expired the other day.  just by coincidence, my bank charged me an 8.00 monthly fee for being poor the day i signed up.  i thought it was netflix charging me by mistake - but this brought my account pretty low, so when the charge for the first month hit, it resulted in overdraft.  didn't know this until i called my bank.  so i got charged money for being poor...and then got charged more money for not having enough money, though i would have survived the second charge if not for the first.

hope this doesn't come off as whiny.  i know other people have it way worse, and this is clearly a firstworldproblems kind of thing.  still, it's only 12:30 and i'm lonely, depressed, and broke.  a pizza would go a long way toward lifting my spirits.

edit:  forgot a general location - i live in the u.s.; southern louisiana, specifically.
[] cold, rainy night in connecticut.  would love a warm pizza to keep me company. hey everybody,

i stumbled into this subreddit yesterday, and the kindness and generosity that is flowing through here absolutely warms my heart.  i don't have a sob story or a starving family to feed, just a kid putting himself through college, so i'm saving every penny i scrape together.

if someone saw it in their heart to help a complete stranger out, i would be incredibly appreciative. 
[] seattle i've bought pizza for random irc friends at least 10x, never got any myself :(. i often buy pizza and ramen and things like that for irc friends, but they are usually too broke to help me out when things get tough on my end. i have $10 in the bank until friday.

[] tempe, az usa. broke, but i'm making my way back!. hey redditors, i'll try and keep it short. i've been broke for quite some time with just enough money to pay for rent. i recently got a job, working i.t., but i wont see a check until the end of the month. my sob story isn't all that bad, i'm glad to finally have a job! i just don't have any money yet for any food.

i was just wondering if /r/random_acts_of_pizza would be willing to help me through this saturday night.

[] between jobs and could really use some food.. i'm 24, live in missouri, and could really use some food with sustenance. i'm between jobs and living with a friend who is paying for the rent and bills until i can find work. any kindness would be greatly appreciated! thank you!

thank you for reading if you made it this far. i know it would be very easy to ignore this. but a random act of generosity could sustain me in body and soul for a few days longer.
[] last of our money went to surprise gift of puppy, no money til next friday. (northern california). my boyfriend's mom has been hinting at the fact that she would like to have a lap dog to keep her company.  boyfriend and i find the perfect one and spend the last of our cash for the week to get it we. bring it over to surprise her with it and her controlling boyfriend says she can't have the dog because he didn't get her for it.  so now we have a sweet new puppy to find a home for, and no money.  not to mention that my boyfriend is devastated by this (he doesn't know i am posting).  pizza would help boost his crushed spirit.

tl:dr tried to surprise boyfriend's mom with dog she wanted, got denied by her controlling boyfriend. boyfriend devastated.
[] celebratory pizza for my fiance and i. we eloped to puerto rico with no money. . my fiance and i have eloped here after almost a month and a half of moving from the mid west. everyone along the way has either been extremely beligerent towards us or unaccepting of the vision we have for ourselves and the world. it has been an especially trying last week as we've spent half of it stuck in first, a florida airport, then in san juan. we weren't even sure we were going to make it, if we'd be mugged or what. we're two attractive young (relatively) women. you can imagine the time we've had.

anyway, we finally have a safe place to crash and would really really appreciate a big pizza, just for the two of us. 

too bad we can't request 420. lol have a good night and infinite gratitude to those who reply/offer. 
[] indiana, usa pizza after a long day of moving and cleaning. . greetings!

my parents are in the process of moving into their new home after being homeless for about a month. there have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. i've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.

unfortunately, after i arrived i learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a "crazy cat lady" and the house still reeks of urine. (there are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)

i have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. today my father and i spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)

anyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (tuesday) night. i'm not financially able to supply any food while i'm staying here, and i was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.

thanks!
() i could really use anything to eat right now.. so, it's been pretty hard lately. my mom was laid off from her job as a teachers aid. there's canned stuff but we ate all the feasible stuff and now only have stuff like pureed carrots. the pizza wouldn't actually be for me, i'll survive, but i would really like something to brighten up my sisters day. my mother told her she didn't have to go to school today because she knew she may not be able to concentrate that much but my sister , who is 9 was like eff that and had cream corn for breakfast and went anyway. she is trying so hard not to be sad because she doesn't want to make my mom feel bad. she even offered to sell(pawn) her nintendo ds to pay the water bill that came today. but my mom promised we wouldnt do that anymore...thanks to anyone who wants to help!

[] i paid it forward once and bought a pizza for someone else, wondering if i could have a turn receiving :) (st. louis, mo). last year, i had to kick my ex out (he was threatening me), and in order to support myself, i took on a second job.  during that time, i bought a pizza for someone who was struggling.  they never came back to thank me :(  but i still felt good :)

early this year, i had to quit the second job - my doctor said the additional stress was causing hypertension, among other things.  now, i'm struggling to pay all my bills.  i currently have less than a dollar in my checking account, and missed work yesterday due to illness.  it'd be great to receive a pizza - to be able to skip having to cook tonight since i'm still under the weather.

any help would be appreciated.  promise!  :d  thanks
[] sick and out of work with no health insurance.. i've been sick 3 out of 4 weeks this month and i'm hoping its not something serious. i've been out of work quite a bit this month (although i'm going back tomorrow) and haven't been able to get medicine because i have no health insurance! anyway raop, can you help me out? i will pay it forward next paycheck (on the 25th, since my paycheck on the 11th will barely be there). thanks in advance! whether i get pizza or not this subreddit is a great thing! :) 
[] just moved into our new place and we could sure use some pizza to ease the moving stresses.. hi all, 

we just moved across canada and are moving into our new place here in edmonton, alberta. long story short, the movers completely botched our move and we are not getting our property for another week. the move has been tough on us financially and emotionally, we could use a break. wondering if anyone out there wants to send some pizza over our way. we will return the favour in two weeks once we get settled into our new place.
[]need something to hold me over until morning. hi raop, there are some great offers up right now but most don't seem to be drawing for a few days. that's nice but by tomorrow morning i'll actually be able to grab some bare essentials like milk, eggs, bread, and cereal. i was just wondering if somebody could help me out because my only option here is to heat a can of tomato puree. 

edit: i'm in the northern suburbs of chicago.
[] been having a hard time lately :(. this is a throwaway account because my family and friends are redditors. 

i have been having a hard time lately and don't know what to do. my
girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me recently, my dad passed away, my depression is getting to me, i'm failing 2 college classes, and i just lost my job. i know this subreddit isn't for begging but i just want a pizza to help clear my mind off of things. i know its not much but winning a pizza would actually make me a little bit happy. if you would be so kindly as to give me a pizza then i would be thankful. i live with 2 other people in a dorm room (if that matters) in houston, texas. thank you for taking the time to read this post and have a good day. i know there are a lot of scammers on this subreddit so if no one comments or gifts me a pizza then no worries. i will gladly repay this favor when i get the chance to. god bless you and thanks for reading this.

[] college station, tx. pizza in return for an itunes card.. basically, i have 22 cents in my bank account and am craving pizza. i don't like asking for things but, all i have are gift cards. so, i am offering a [$25 itunes giftcard] (http://i.imgur.com/kljkq.jpg) in return for pizza! it's a win-win situation. 
[] in debt in london, wont be able to get food until wednesday. i've been a fool with my money basically. i'm a student in london in my first year. i'm getting a ride home on wednesday but until then i'm out of pocket and very hungry. a slice would be very appreciated.
[]stuck at home for the past week because of the flu. been surviving on ramen because i'm out of pto.  . like the title says.  been so sick that i can't even go grocery shopping.  i'd order my own but i'm on a tight budget right now and not working for a week has kind of screwed me.  ran out of ramen today and i just heard of this sub so i figured i'd give it a shot. 

i'll gladly reimburse in a few weeks. 
[] brooklyn, ny: just moved apartments. exhausted, lonely, and very hungry.. edit: taken care of yay.

hello lovely pizza givers,

i'm a young gal living in brooklyn, and i just moved from my cozy apartment into a basement room. i'm very sad to have left what was my home, my cat won't come out from under the couch, and moving down four flights of narrow stairs really made my tummy rumble. after paying for a u-haul and a huge load of cleaning supplies, i'm out of disposable income until my next paycheck, but goodness would i love a delicious, cheesy, pipin' hot pizza. 

thanks to all the kind souls who are putting faith in humanity back into the aether.

love,
t.

edit:
p.s. i know this is a blankish account. i'm a lurking sort of lady. if you'd like any further verification from me, i can do that. also, i'll draw anyone a sketch who asks for one, just for shits and giggles.

p.p.s. ohmyglob. the amazing pizzamom gifted me a pizza and i am so very pleased. expect photos shortly.
[] home alone in southern maine after terminating a pregnancy, could use a pick me up! . for obvious reasons, i created a new account for this request. to prove that i'm not just trolling you guys, i took [a picture](http://imgur.com/a/r24lh) of my medication bottle and some of the literature i was given at the appointment where i had to terminate the pregnancy. 

before anyone judges me (though i know this is a friendly group of people; i have been fortunate enough to receive before under my real username), i believe i did the right thing, and my partner didn't just abandon me after i did this. i got the (*gulp*) abortion on friday, and he made sure i was taken care of during the worst of the aftermath. but today, he's at work, and i'm pretty much confined to the couch. there is food in the house, but it's stuff i'd have to prepare. preparing a real meal for just myself while i'm still crampy doesn't seem like fun right now...

i'm willing to reveal my identity and real username to the person willing to gift me, in private of course, to also prove that i've been on reddit for quite some time. i also have a few bucks here for a tip for a delivery driver (i obviously can't drive right now). 

i know there are people on here who haven't received who are more deserving, but i'd love some comfort food. absolute understanding if no one feels like it, though. :-)
[] alaska usa, starving music producer/composer will make you any style of personalized song for a pizza.. ive been eating nothing but rice and when im lucky ramen for almost 4 months now since being laid off from my computer repair gig. i live in alaska where the economy and culture is about 4-5 years delayed from the rest of the us so the recession is only now starting to really take hold here, as such ive been unable to find any regular work even at any of the typical franchised fast food joints. but i can make music, so if there is any kind of song you have ever wanted to hear or have made for yourself, a loved one, a personal project, or perhaps a video or web-series of yours; tell me about it and i will make it happen for a pizza. preferably a pizza with meat on it, i literally have dreams of meat and cheese these days. 

i can do electronic, hip-hop, blues, rock, doom metal, black metal, world/ethnic, orchestral pieces, 80s synth pop, ambient, almost anything really. if desired, i could sing a name, tagline, or slogan and do it jingle style or even use crazy robot voice effects. i could also mimic a specific artists style. [here are some examples of my production.](https://soundcloud.com/metacitizen)

tldr: will music for food
[] some pizza for tonight, hungry and wont get paid for a bit. . pretty simple here. just hungry and wont get paid for a little bit so looking to see if a fellow redditor would be willing to help me out for the night. the major 3 are all within distance of me and will be able to pay that person back once paid.

[] i would like a pizza as an "oops, i forgot an anniversary present" gift, st. louis mo. my girlfriend and i have been dating for six months today and i was being the guy i am and didn't get a gift. it turns out that she had gotten me a gift and i didn't get her one, even though we agreed on no gifts. so if anyone could help me out, that would be amazing. i promise to pay it forward when i get paid next week.
[] i'm unemployed, low income, and without any food in my fridge.. i used to be on social security but they cut me off and i'm in a phase of transition from codependency to job status and can't afford dinner tonight. it would be amazing if someone could hit me up with a meal.

i can draw animals and stuff, i'll totally draw art for pizza.

please and thank you?
[] mtl, qc- it's been a bad day. work was cancelled last minute today, for the 2nd time in two weeks.  it's been a bad month, but today has been a particularly bad day- the kind of day that you struggle to get through without crying from the stress of everything.  pizza would be a nice break from the dreariness of the day!
[] central valley, ca. dog sitting tonight, would love a pizza to keep me company. . these three dogs are a handful and are making me hungry! would love a pizza this new years eve as my spouse/in-laws are out of town and i'm feeling kinda lonely. thanks in advance :)
[] girlfriend's mother is on a psycho-bender (brattleboro,vt). my girlfriend usually stays home during the semester because it's closer to the college.  most of the time she otherwise lives with me.  we are both in our mid-twenties. this evening, she was home, and her mom decides to do yet another psycho-parent sniff test disguised as a hug.  convinced she smells "cigarettes or pot" (and obviously doesn't know the difference) on her adult daughter, she goes on a baseless accusatory my-house-my-rules rager.  she lives an hour away but decided she'd just rather live with me than suffer through that again.  we're saving up to move away to colorado, and we'd really love to just chill out and eat some pizza tonight.  domino's is the only thing around; if anyone wants to help, we would definitely pay it forward in the future.  i'd love to be able to surprise her with not having to cook dinner when she gets here.  thank you.
[] salem, indiana in need of pizza!. 
[] cc student in need of real food and real kindness!. i'm a community college student who hasn't had a decent meal in quite some time. i've been eating two or three eggs a day all semester. (the cheapest food really, 2 1/2 dozen for about $4 at my local salvage grocery, that's about 15 cents an egg! way cheaper and more nutritious than ramen noodles!) but i've only two left and after that its a cold water diet until my next paycheck in a week, which is mostly going towards rent and gas. (may have to sell this computer)

i know there are others around the world who are more in need but goodness i sure would love some pizza. as a younger kid, i took good food for granted now it has become a priority and i feel foolish for my prior attitude. if nothing else i would love some words of encouragement or anything that's ever helped you when times got tough. and, if it means anything, i will make a promise to do two random acts of pizza whenever it is a little more plausible.

a big thanks to this subreddit, you guys are a real honor to the internet and the power of kindness! keep up the good work and if you can't help me please do it for someone else as i know you will! :)

[] two sick canadian redditor roommates need food. we have been living off left over turkey stuffing and rationing cutting up hot dogs into it while sick for the past few days. we are broke until the end of the month and could really use anything. a 12$ large pepperoni would be ideal since its cheap for you and enough food to to last us tonight and even breakfast tomorrow.

thanks to anyone who even takes the time to look at this.
responsibility doesn't always pay off. []. here it is, the first of the month.  my bills are paid off, i'm in minimal debt, and once again both my mother and my ex-girlfriend haven't paid me back.  i have some rice and a can of green beans, and hot sauce.  if i could collect interest or force them to pay, i would, but i'm just not the kind of guy to stress the important ladies in my life just so i can enjoy a small luxury of life; so i'm asking youuu!

i don't have much to give in return, but i'm a fairly decent wordsmith and i do still have some l3375k1ll5 online, so i can even play something with you if you're that bored, or write you something.  my senior humanities project was a star trek fan script, fyi.

thanks in advance to all whom at least read this lone whimper in a sea of screams.

[] medical bills and stress piling up, could use a nice pizza for my kids. my wife is in the hospital and along with the costs of her surgery (she injured her eye and jaw in a car accident), the stress this has been on my 7 year old girl and 5 year old boy is extraordinary. i haven't had time to get decent food for them and a pizza would...to be honest...a blessing. life hasn't always been this hard on my family and i eagerly anticipate the day i can pay this forward.
[] first time i've been broke in years. hey reddit.  i've never had to do this before and it's pretty embarrassing.  i literally have just change in my bank account and don't get paid again until friday.  i figure if i find someone nice enough to send me a pizza, i could have a slice tonight and lunch and meals for a few days.  i'd greatly appreciate it and you have my word, on friday this week i'll put in a post to pay it back.  i have a real reddit name of over 2 years this is just a throw away because i'm too embarrassed.  thanks guys!!

doh! never done this before.  i'm in md.  sorry it's not in the title!
[] in between jobs and could use some pizza. i've been job searching for a bit now but haven't had much luck or funds for pizza. my accounts actually overdrawn at the moment and any more cash would cause some bullshit overdraft fee so thats out of the question.  could really use a cheesey pick me up :)

[ for uk] pizza for our 7 year anniversary. my partner and i will have been together (in person) 7 years tomorrow (april 16).

we meet online while i was teaching in korea. when i finished my contract, i went home (nz) for a month before i flew to sweden to meet him in real life. prior to that we'd skype 6-7 hours a day, email and send letters

life has been really hard. i haven't been able to go back to nz, we had to go through his family company (no fault of their own) going through bankruptcy, moving country and visa issues.

we left our jobs at the end of january and moved out of london in the hopes that we could find a place to settle down and have kids. 
we lived in at our jobs and worked together in a very stressful situations that really began to affect our relationship and health. another reason we needed to move.

we've found it really hard to find jobs since though we've applied for everything and anything, pub jobs, cleaning jobs anything.

tomorrow is our 7 year anniversary and we can't afford to do anything.
which is ok, we still have each other and we're getting along really well again despite the pressures and stress of both being out of work and worried sick about money.

anyhow, a pizza tomorrow night would be well-appreciated.
and the favour will be paid forward as soon as we're in work again.

thank you for your response lolly, or maybe tack is more appropriate.


[]extremely hungry, would love some pizza. yeah, my parents are both unemployed and we never ever can afford to actually buy a luxury like pizza. all we have are pantry items, like peas and some cereal. nothing really good. haven't had pizza in forever, and i havent eaten for awhile because my sister ate the last of the cereal and the rest of the food is diet food for my mom. all i have, is some little snacks, like grapes. i can draw a pretty picture for you, and put your name on it! (: i can video tape me doing some corny jokes/pickup lines. willing to do close to anything, im sooo hungry. im in santa fe springs, california. 
[] worst day of my life. and my girlfriends.. lost my job a month ago, 50 cents left in my account. girlfriend had a tax return coming that she waited this long for and it turns out her student loan offset it so that sucks. i owe $160 in bills and have no idea how i'm going to pay my $600 rent. no luck on the job front after a month. and on top of that, i can't get unemployment because the company that let me go for *some* reason still says i'm employed there so i can't get unemployment benefits. so i'm wrestling with that, waiting for someone to return my call after i sent them all the termination paperwork i was given. literally no food left in the house, it's gonna hurt like hell but i'm thinking of pawning my guitar tomorow to keep us afloat for a week or so. oh, and her car broke down. today of all days. my girlfriend told me to try posting here, i'd asked once before but it didn't work out and this years been *roooough*. but it seems like everyone's on hard times so i understand if my story isn't sad enough. you don't even have to buy me a pizza, just tell me it'll all be okay.

edit: should also mention, girlfriend's employed in a cafe at a local college, but it's closed this month so she's temporarily out of work as well. she's overdrawn about 40 or so so she's in even worse shape than i am. what a day.
[] nursing school student with finals and practicals tomorrow and wednesday! - indiana, usa. hi everyone! i'm in the nursing program at a state college in indiana, and i have practicals and a final for one of my nursing classes tomorrow...as you can imagine my stress, a pizza that anyone could give me, i would greatly appreciate! thank you! :)
[] district of columbia. engineering student who just found out his research stipend got cancelled.... yeah, going to be living off a lot of ramen for the next two months so was hoping that a nice redditor could help me out with dinner tonight. i'll also upvote all of your links because that's the least way to say thanks.
[] a pie for a timelord on on his luck. . i have no monies at the current moment until i sell my minivan for 2500. i hope it sells for 2500. until such a time i am lacking food. a nice peperoni pie would be wonderful if anyone is so inclined. 

i will return the favor and come here and buy someone a nice box of goodness once my van sells. 

i have just fallen on bad times, i have poof of my lack of funds if that is needed. 

i forgot to tell my location in the title, i am currently stuck in the panhandle of florida.  

*edit: looks like i can not make a complete sentence. oh well that is life.* 

*edit 2: nazoth gave me some pizza, well gave me a gift card. live so far out, delivery isn't an option. that explains the odd sounds i hear at night. i swear it might be an ood. i shall ride into town in my blue minivan to pick me up a nice pie. i'll be sure to share the love once said ride is sold, in order to keep folks with some pizza. everyone likes pizza*

[] college kid miscalculated rent and is thus broke. like red numbers in my checking account.. so, i overdrew my account paying rent, and then i got the overdraft fee. so i'm like doubly overdrawn. i have training for a job on saturday but like, payday won't be till thursday. i have one thing of easy mac left in the cabinet, maybe some pasta, but man, i am so stressed out. hook a stupid kid up with a cheese pizza? would totally rock my weekend. if you wanted to go crazy, barbecue chicken pizza, but hey a large cheese pizza would feed me for a while, like 4 meals. i'm batting my eyelashes here. thanks for hearing me out. 
[] broke and hungry, please help (aus/nz). i recently lost my job due to cost cutting, and now i have to wait until tuesday before my first unemployment cheque goes through. can someone please jsut help me out until tuesday? i'd really appreciate it and will pay it forward on wednesday.

[] working on a web publishing final and am starving, anyone care to feed a hungry student?. i've been working on a web publishing final all day, and am finally nearing completion. though in the process, i forgot to get to the cafe in time to get myself a decent meal. all i've got here is cheese and bread, and while a staple, just isn't enough.

would anyone care to give a raop papajohn's e-giftcard? they're the only place around here.

[] going to be completely honest, broke college student staying the summer at school with no friends or girlfriend at the moment, hungry.. hi there. ill be the first to admit, this is my first time in this subreddit. i only heard about you guys after watching the x-post on /videos but im glad i have.

i am not homeless, nor am i in serious need of a meal but i am a college student who is currently staying for the summer and taking summer classes to make sure i can get out of here as soon as possible because im unfortunately paying my way through school for now. im lonely up here and all my friends and roommates are home for the summer so its just me up here. i recently split from my girlfriend so that isnt helping my situation. i do have a job but im only getting 10 hours a week (even for summer) so im super low on money right now and havent been able to eat out in weeks. i know most posts arent like this or maybe they are im kinda new to this community, but i would greatly appreciate a pizza, even a personal mini one. anything at all would boost my spirits and hopefully get me out of this funk. im here to stay and as soon as i can get enough money to buy myself a pizza ill return the favor and reward someone else in much greater need. cheers!
[] baltimore, md. starving, no money, no food...please reach out.
[][uk] bad depression day - real bad, i just need some food.. so, i won't bore you with the gruesome details. last night, i had a really good time with some friends, and this morning, the charming head of mental illness decided to punch the good times clean out of me. i was awful to the people that i love, and now i'm on my own, too frightened out of my mind of what they think of me to talk to anybody. i probably don't deserve this, but i just need to eat something - i haven't been able to in a few days, and my stomach is making some ungodly noises.

i wouldn't normally ask, but my bank account is already in overdraft, and i don't ask for much - i have a usual order, and it comes to just over a fiver. if anyone could help, i will definitely pay it forward should you ever be in need. god knows, i've got plenty to make up for.
[] hoping for pizza in tn. laid off earlier in the month... my bank account is in the red (-$0.39!). we're hungry and tired of canned vegetables and chicken helper. can't even remember the last time we had pizza! we live a ways out from town... we don't have enough gas to pick any pizza up, and the only place where i live that delivers where i am is papa john's. thanks for your consideration!
[]atlanta, ga. bank of america screwed me over and now i'm left without funds for food. since bank of america is bad at being a bank, they canceled my old debit card without sending me a new one because they may or may not have leaked some information regarding my account. so now here i am left without any means of acquiring food for the next couple days and a pizza pie would be really nice. 
[] single, 33, unemployed 4 months.. i do freelance work online, but it isn't nearly enough to cover the bills. i rely on a local food bank (diabetes makes this difficult), and the assistance of my family. i'm looking for reliable work, but i live in a small town and i don't own a car; it makes things somewhat difficult. i've lived off of water and rice mixes for the last eight days, and could really go for a small pepperoni pizza. nothing fancy; i'm a die-hard pepperoni fan.

please message me, if you're feeling generous. there's a papa johns and a pizza hut within delivery distance, and a couple of mom &amp; pop places within a short walking distance.
() lancaster/pa mother and daughter trying to keep cool.. we have no running air conditioner and the thought of having to turn the oven on turns my stomach. we don't have much to eat our food stamps don't come in for a few more days. if anyone could send us a pizza i would be very grateful. thank you. god bless!

[] no money, laid off, fiance stressed. will gift a few games on steam for a pizza or two, and also post happy pics and love you forever.. hello! i was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. for 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. she has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. we had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since i haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. it's been fairly depressing, and i can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. i hurt my back not long ago and have been in pt getting it fixed up. 
so my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought i would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so i can actually move more. we don't argue about money/food a lot, but i know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. and it hurts me to see it.

anyways. in my fridge is milk and yogurt. rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(rice in cabinet).. and we've basically been eating ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. it's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) i will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.

i have these:

[] polk county, fl - commuting, new job, trying to move...just broke and hungry and tired :(. started a new job that's an hour+ away from me (after being unemployed for nearly 4 months). two weeks before my first check. about $6 in my bank account and everything else goes to gas and moving expenses so i don't have to drive so far for this job. maxing out credit card just paying for gas and rental deposit. bah.

i'm tired and hungry and just want a giant pizza and some soda.
[] student in montreal pulling an all-nighter.. no sad story, i'm just a really hungry (and broke) student working on an essay that's due tomorrow. wrote 1500 words yesterday thinking i could write another 2000 easily...i was wrong aha. 

it's shitty cause if i'm this broke now, i'm going to be even more broke next year with tuition hikes. 
() broke college student down on luck. very hungry.. my girlfriend and i live together and usually rely on her pell grant money to get us through the semester. unfortunately, this year, we were both denied financial aid. luckily a member of her family took out a loan so she could go to school. i cannot. so here we are, knowing our paychecks are going to pay our late rent instead of food, which we have run out of. tomorrow i plan to go sell some things to the pawn shop to get us through for a while. but we haven't eaten today. i know this is asking for a lot. but i don't see us being able to eat for at least another two days. could someone help us out? thank you for reading this.
[] portland, or. spent most of my money putting my so on a plane to alaska to work for the summer... miss him already, could use some comfort food.. pretty much exactly what it says in the title. i don't get paid for another two weeks, but i'm not starving. i could just really go for something pizza-like and maybe a 2-liter of soda to curl up on the couch with. :)
[] munich, germany - haven't eaten in two days, ate nothing but ramen for the last month and couldn't buy food in 3 months. [this is also a crosspost from /r/randomactsofpizza - i'll close that posting if i get a reply here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofpizza/comments/z59hz/request_havent_eaten_in_two_days_ate_nothing_but/)

so about 3 months ago i was fired from my old job. that's normally not a problem here in germany, but to make a very long story short: the government agencies that are supposed to help you out in a case such as this didn't help me out. i haven't recieved any money in 3 months. so i have been living off of left-overs some friends bring by sometime. i'm a freelance voice-actor, but i haven't gotten any contracts lately, except for a bigger one 1 1/2 weeks ago.

however, my 'boss' there hasn't paid me yet. i'm about to lose my apartment and i ran out of food.

i'm not sitting idly by though - i've been sending out cvs like crazy and have gotten an interview for next week. we'll see how that goes.

so yeah, there's the short version of what happened. i don't really know what i'm supposed to write here, sorry. if you have any question, go ahead and ask.

if anyone is actually willing to send me pizza, then there could be a minor problem seeing as i live in germany. but - if you have a credit card (mastercard/visa) we could use [lieferando](http://www.lieferando.de). i can guide you through the ordering process via skype for example - or i'll write something up.

if you want me to do something for the pizza: i could record something for you.

thanks for reading, i guess?
()just ate my last taco shell........ so broke:(i'm from vista,ca moving to boston in about a week, but i seriously have no money and have to figure out how i'm gonna get by until then. i don't really have any friends to help me out otherwise i wouldn't be so flipping hungry!!! 
    i hate asking favors but if there's anyone out there who could help a brother out, i would be eternally grateful! as a sign of good faith i will even make an art piece dedicated to my pizza 
[] fraudulent activity has made me unable to buy food today. there was fraudulent activity on my account thursday morning. i got a call and an e-mail from my bank saying that they froze my account and when i confirmed that the charges were in fact fraud cancelled my card. a new one is on it's way, but that doesn't help me with my hunger today. i can provide proof with the e-mail they sent me thursday morning. 
thanks everyone!

[] we've got literally no food left until wednesday (stock check included). here's a list of current edible food (edible, keyword people):

1. 4 eggo waffles (syrup is dated july 2009, we're good like that).
2. 1/4 box generic cinnamon toast crunch - no milk.
3. 1/3 bag stale cheetos.
4. hot cocoa powder (no marshmallows included, what are we, animals?)
5. 1 slice of american cheese, no bread or crackers.
6. 1/10 bear of honey (went well with the waffles last 2 days tbqh).
7. 10-15 otter pops (piña colada flavor, useless).

if anyone would be willing to help out a couple of dudes in need, i'd definitely pay it forward as soon as i can (most likely a couple weeks). keep in mind, that is a literal stock check of edible food. there is no hidden ramen or sandwich materials, and the last of our funds went towards keeping the cats fed.

[] laid off on day off wichita, ks. i've been debating whether to post here or not, because i am just beyond shocked. my boss called this morning and said they company had to let me go. he said they had to let several people go and because i was newer i guess i would be one of the first to go. i just started a month ago and had been looking for work for 4 months. i don't know what to tell the wife as i've been at the computer most of the day trying to take my mind off of it while looking for work. i'm hoping she will take the news as best as she can over a good meal. we're not without food, but i know that she loves pepperoni and mushroom pizza. 

what's left in the bank and what's coming in the next check will all go to bills, so i really have no way of treating her to her favorite. i've worked hard to provide for my family, but i feel like less of a man when i can't. i'm hoping someone can help me treat my wife to her favorite and that she will handle the situation well. thank you for reading and understanding.

[] beaverton, or area - wife and i are stressed and broke. she just texted me and said all she wants right now is pizza. please help me surprise her!. we just moved to the area, and as a result of putting down a huge deposit on our new home and getting in a recent accident, and my wife starting a new job that turned out to be the opposite of what she was told, we are broke and stressed. she just texted me and said she really would like some pizza and wine for dinner tonight just to relax her nerves, but we don't have enough right now to afford either.

[] usa illinois, just a kid who wants to mess with his parents. it's not about the food. i have dinner already made, so i won't be going hungry. i just think itll be funny watching what my parents do getting free pizza when we already ate dinner. if they'll take it out not, if they'll argue of what. actually, if someone could get the pizza to arrive at like 9 or 10, it'll probably be even better. it doesn't even need to be pizza, just something, breadsticks maybe. just something to make my parents wonder why there's summertime at our door at 10 o clock

[] been living on ramen and pasta for the past week. see inside for more info.. some help please? i do have more ramen and pasta. just want a delectable pie instead with a twist on the process.

i have been here before and have made requests. my one caveat is that i can pay the willing giver back with a pizza when i get paid. in this case it will be this friday.

however this time i want to do something different. i want to either pay it forward to a person of the givers choice with an included explanation as to why the person deserves a pie, or by giving me an explanation as to why you have decided to give to me a pie.

i want to do it this way to provide some entertainment for the sub, and so this doesn't look like just another desperate request. i look forward to your stories and reasoning.

[] girlfriend and i are exhausted from preparing to move to the land of no pizza.. i preemptively realize that this post is at a severe risk of sounding like a pity party, but i want to make it clear that i am not trying to create a sob story here. but, i also want to be honest. know that i am happy (pizza or not)! with that disclaimer out of the way, here is sort of what is happening in my life, cliff-note style.

-i am poor in the college-student sort of way. my parents are broke, so i worked my way through college working for at&amp;t 40 hours a week.

-i did well in college

-upon graduating, i received a us government grant to move to taiwan for a year.

-yay!

-however, there was a six month gap between college and moving to taiwan, one that was really hard to fill with employment. so, we are pretty broke.

-the last few weeks of my life have been insane. applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything i own... you get the idea. my gf and i have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. we are exhausted and broke.

-i am leaving to taiwan in 4 days, and i still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.

-from what i understand, the pizza situation in taiwan is quite depressing :(

so, i ask for some help for my gf and i, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).

i had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. i always figured that if i did, i would be giving away a pizza. but, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.

pizza or not, i think this is a really cool subreddit, and i am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.

thanks for listening, and i can't wait until i am in a position to be the pizza giver.

edit: sorry, i am in the atlanta, ga area. i just re-read the info site and noticed i missed this bit.

[] family in northwest indiana. ~~reddit has given me a lot lately, and i am very thankful. so if you are going to choose between me and someone that needs it more, go with someone else. i have a 6 person family - me, husband, and kids 10, 5, 4, and turning 2 next month - and with me having to buy the parts for a new computer (i make my living online) and trying to buy xmas presents, we aren't going to be able to eat anything that isn't homemade for awhile. i normally make pizza myself, but we're out of cheese. my 4 year old has asked me every morning for the past 3 days if we can have pizza for dinner...~~

someone that wishes to remain anonymous sent me some pizza. thanks so much!!
[] hoping to get a pizza tonight. not trying to give a sob story. times are rough right now and my mom had some medical issues that i left college to come home to help with. a pizza would brighten both of our days. i'll pay it forward as soon as i can afford to do so.

[*!*] pizza for my friend in la. i'm not asking for pizza for myself (i'm vegan) but for my friend. he lives in la (i live on the east coast) and has fallen on hard times. he's going to school and will graduate in december, but was laid off a couple of months ago and will soon be evicted. i don't really have any expendable income at the moment. maybe some internet kindness can lift his spirits. thank you. 
(offer) pizza for a redditor who has never ed/received before. it seems like a lot of requests are from people who had requested repeatedly in the past, sometimes that is all they post on reddit. i would like to give a pizza to a redditor who has contributed lots of non-pizza posts. 

i'll plan on giving the person i choose a pizza tomorrow. pm me :)

[] vote for my girlfriend's dad's pizza restaurant. i don't ask for any pizza i only ask for your vote in a local pizza poll.

[] finally went to school after 2 years of severe anxiety!. i've never been this happy in years. yesterday, i finally made it to school for the first time in 2 years. i have social phobia and depression and i would never even step foot outside my apartment, even to walk my dog. after years of therapy and medication, i somehow managed to gather up my courage and start a new life for myself. 
    i would love to celebrate with a pizza! i really wish i could provide proof, but i'm not sure how i can prove this kind of stuff. i can say, however that i live in ny.

[]  got a call back, but they said i didn't get the job.  bummed out in south carolina =/. i had applied for this job that would have been perfect for me.  my current job is so stressful it puts me in tears every other week, and with christmas coming it is just bound to get worse.  i went in and interviewed and they said they would talk it over.  they hadn't expected to hire anyone but my application had skills on it that are just rare and they could use.  (i worked in an engraving/framing shop, and they have an engraving part to their store)

turns out though that my available hours just aren't what they're looking for.  i can either compromise my study time for school to take this job, causing me school stress, or i can stay at my already shitty place but not have school stress.  either way, stress.

so i'm bummed, and could really use a pizza.  or better yet, subway, since i'm supposed to be on a diet/making a life change.  but today i just don't care as much about that as i should.  between finding that out, and my desktop computer with all my awesomeness not turning on yesterday, my thanksgiving break has just been shit.   

(no idea what's wrong with the computer.  it's getting power, but when it turns on it sounds like eight hundred fans turn on inside, and it never goes to a login screen.  i don't know enough about computers to fix it. that was usually the ex-husbands job)

long story short, my computer is broke, and i didn't get a job that would have made my life hella easier.  i'm bummed and want to eat comfort food.

fyi- would have to be for pickup.  i live too far out for delivery.

[] student in mount pleasant, mi. hey everyone,

so, i was a student at central michigan university last semester, but due to financial reasons, i couldn't attend this semester.  i used the last of my money recently to sign onto a friends lease, so my bank accounts are currently zero-ed out, and i don't have a credit card.

  i had gotten hired by a pyramid scheme place, and they didn't pay me, even though i met the criteria to get paid.  i just had orientation for a new job, but i won't start for another week, and won't get paid for another two.  i have almost no food in this house, except for some bread, and some crackers.  is there any way someone could send me some pizza? it'd be greatly appreciated, and i would pay it forward once i have some cash. 

thanks for reading.

[] pizza would be nice right about now [hesperia, ca]. i'll be honest, there are other people here who probably deserve a pizza more than i do, but at the moment, a pizza sounds really good.
as background, i'm a college student living in hesperia, ca (aka: one of the most boring regions of california), who is currently composing a sonnet for his creative writing class. i've been craving pizza for the past few days, but i haven't been able to buy any because of the financial aid office holding out on student grants/loans. a recent switch to a college debit card system has pretty much put a lot of people's money in limbo for the time being. this has been annoying, to say the least, since i have books to buy, a gas tank to fill, and an oil leak to fix as well.

right now, i would only have my gratitude to offer as thanks. anything would be appreciated.
don't want to spend rent money / ask parents for help. []. i have ~20 bucks on me since i sent the rent check off yesterday, and i hate asking my parents for cash when i get paid from my job on the 15th. i'm at work now (on campus job) and don't really want to eat pop tarts for dinner. there's a dominos next to campus that always has cheap student specials, but i want to try and make my 20 dollars last as long as possible simply because i don't want to ask for bailout from my parents (trying to actually be an adult and make a living for myself.)

it's okay if you guys want to give to someone more needy! i just kinda thought i'd try and see if this struck with anyone familiar with the situation! best of luck to everyone out there!

if someone can help great, if not, thank you anyways. we do have junk food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies but no pizza. dominoes will work if anyone is interested in helping me surprise my family. thanks

[] have had a run of bad luck in the last few days... will return the favor next week.... so i had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and i stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. note: i used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but i moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when i wanted to start trading. 

he took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill i will never know. schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before i noticed what had happened. after spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, i was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.

today i'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. i call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. so i had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (if you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) now to add to all of this when i was younger i messed up my credit pretty badly, and i have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. so basically i have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. 

also being a single guy during finals i didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so i am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that i only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. now i could stretch what i have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. i normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. the second i have access to my accounts and money again i plan on passing it along. 

tl;dr: i got fucked by my ex-roomate. to "protect" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me i would still be able to use them. so i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.

[] haven't had a good meal in 2 days sioux falls, sd. i've been a long time lurker and did not want to post from my main username. things have really hit the fan in more ways than one. my employer told me on monday that this would be the last week the store would be operating. even though this short notice is appreciated (i honestly thought i would show up for work one day and see a for sale sign on the building), she shorted my last two checks and has not corrected that yet. i'm not expecting my last check to include what she still owes me. i've done my best to juggle my bills and i had a real hard decision to make - keep the lights on or buy groceries. i ended up paying the power and buying a case of ramen. after eating this for a few days, my stomach is literally screaming for anything else. 

i'm willing to provide a copy of my bills, my last checks (and what it should have been) as well as anything else that may be needed for verification. i am humbly requesting a pizza, please. i hope that someone out there can hook me up. thank you for reading.

i'm wondering if there a chance someone would be willing to help me out as well. i'm a stay at home mom, raising my three little ones, jason (6) and michelle and christina (both 3 1/2), while my husband works. sadly, he lost his job about a year ago, and with this economy, he has only been able to pick up jobs here and there, and we're getting towards the end of our savings.

i would love to be able to sit down with a nice pizza dinner one night, and just be able to relax and enjoy the company of one another, that is, before the little ones start crying again. pizza used to be a luxury purchase for us before, now it is almost impossible.

anyone with a soft spot in their heart able to help out?

thanks

[]would love a pizza to brighten up my parents' day. i'm 33 years old and i've been unemployed for 18 months. most of the new jobs in my hometown of tullahoma, tn, are far beyond my reach of experience (i.e., medical jobs like registered nurses, etc.). i live with my parents and obviously times have been tough on all of us. my dad works a job he hates but has to stick with it so we can have money to live on;my mom is disabled and can't work. most of the time we have to rely on local churches to help pay our bills and put gas in our car. while a pizza would definitely raise my spirits it would do the same for my parents. i hate seeing them suffer like this as i get turned down for new jobs. needless to say times are becoming tougher for my family because the money is running out quickly. so please help me put a smile on my parents' faces for at least one day. that way they know someone out there is watching out for us. :)
[] no money, and could really go for a pizza... my wife and i are broke right now due to bills and having a 6 month old (kids are expensive), she's air force and deploys to south korea for a year next month, and it took all our extra money preparing everything and we've been scraping meals together, pretty much only have ramen and canned fruit right now. a pizza, even a cheap simple one, would really be awesome right now, and i promise next pay day i'll pizza someone in return to forward the favor. if no one replies i completely get it! i can provide some kind of proof if requested. thanks everyone!

[] i require nourishment to sustain my myself while attempting to read a truly gargantuan book straight though. wisconsin. i'm indulging myself by spending the weekend doing nothing but reading the way of kings by brandon sanderson. a 1007 page fantasy epic. i'm about 250 pages in already and just realized that i'm hungry. now i'm afraid i'm too sucked into the story to take a half hour away from the book to make something to eat and i lack the orbs* to order food brought to me. so i throw myself at the internet's mercy. be kind and send pizza before i die of an engaging plot.

[] very hungry, please help (details inside). i hate having to ask for help like this, but this is really my last option.  i recently had to take my dog to the vet to have a growth on her leg checked.  the exam was $50, the biopsy was $50.  then the battery in my car went out.  jumping it worked for awhile, but then a few days ago it stopped holding any charge.  new battery was another $100.

for the past 3 days, my husband and i have been subsisting on pasta.  yesterday we ran out of pasta sauce, so i can still eat it, but it's so bland and i'm getting tired of it.  plus, i still breastfeed my son, otherwise i would deal with the blandness, but when my diet tanks, my supply tanks.

(we are in indianapolis)

thanks for reading, let me know if i need to give any more information.

[] and also a bit of a challenge. working for an ngo in brasil. we're all volunteers that live off food donations. also, we're hiring!. i can't say that any of us go hungry, or are living in squalid conditions, but god damnit we get sick of rice and beans. 

we're located in xerém, duque de caxias, rj in brazil. our ngo works with orphans from poor communities, and also provides education and outreach services in many of those same communities. 

i don't even know if ordering a pizza internationally would be even remotely possible where we are, which is why it is a bit of a challenge.

also! we're hiring!! the pay is shit, but this place is amazing. we have plenty of food to eat, and a roof over our heads. the team is fantastic, but completely overwhelmed with work. if you speak spanish or portuguese, and have an interest in this kind of work, we could have you down here in as soon as a month.

not really a sob story but hey ill tell you whats up in my life right now. i live with my gf of 4 years in a modest apartment in some suburb in between dallas and fort worth. in may i was laid off by best buy when they closed the facility i was working in and moved it to kentucky. i have been on unemployment since and have been finding it a might difficult to find a job that will allow me to pay my current bills better than unemployment can. i've gone to college on and off since graduating high school in 03 (if you had asked me then if id be be a college-dropout on unemployment 8 years later...i would've called you nuts) i suppose this is how life goes. 

i'm not sure if this is too long of a post for this and i apologize if it is!

if i don't end up getting pizza, that's all good.. i understand that there may be someone in a more grave situation and by all means i would love for them to get it before i.

{} will fashion cool stories (bro) for chow in ga. the infinite well of ramen noodles has run dry. the villagers were greedy, dipping too often into it with the ladle and tongs. now the children shall starve... unless we can feed them another way?

for a nominal fee of providing edible sustenance that doesn't slurp when i eat it, i shall impart stories of epic proportions based on the whims of the provider. in other words i'll draft a short story based on whatever meaningful or outright ridiculous crap you come up with. am i any good at writing? well, i won a presidential writing award in third grade for an essay i did. i also helped ghost write 2 published works, one of which is in it's fourth printing. the other one was just a paycheck, that lady never stood a chance from the beginning.

the genre is up to you, i can write anything fiction without much trouble. if you want optimus prime to viciously beat rainbow brite with a broken buzz lightyear doll, i'll assemble the necessary back story =). all created works are royalty free, so turn em in to short story contests, publish them in a magazine, whatever.

i am hoping for at least $25 dollars worth of food, i can toss together a good read for that much, and i can eat a couple days off that. but longevity wise i need food for the rest of the week, so the more you donate the longer it'll be. offer is open to anyone and i will accept up to 3 requests for stories, just make sure if you want something "romantic" that it's tasteful or i'll be inclined to turn it down.

that is all, hope i can snag a few jobs and keep the fridge full for a few days, thanks in advance guys =)

 - could really use a pizza, new smyrna beach florida.. here is where i say something witty or heart wrenching one to entice you,  the kind provider, to provide me with a free pizza. but its hard to be witty on an empty stomach (heart wrenching), and i would make a joke about pizza but its too cheesy (witty).   
[] toledo, ohio -- i screwed up…. my rent check, student loan payment, &amp; car payment all went through on the same day. now i'm left with a -$103 account balance and the only thing to eat in my house is apples.

also, i promise i will pay it forward. when i get paid on friday, i solomly swear that the first thing i'll do is pizza someone else in need.

thank you!

[] i don't know if this works but i'm having a terrible time.... so, i just recently graduated from a business college and earned a diploma to work in an office for admin. i was lucky and got a job right out of school. i had to commute to work and a week in my car died, so i went to a dealership to finance one since i didn't have any money saved. yesterday i just got let go of my job. i posted about it in r/jobs here: http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kyxcc/i_got_fired_today_out_of_the_blue/ to gain some sort of advice/motivation. well my new car has been having troubles and i finally had the time to take it in. well my piece of shit extended warranty doesn't cover any of the things wrong with it and it's going to cost me 2500 like i have that lying around. so if there's any kinda strangers who can help a sista out with a pizza that would be great. i want pizza is kinda code when i'm just super sad. since i have celiac disease and eating pizza is a treat for me now even though there's more options for us people who can't have gluten. anywho, if there's any kind soul who can afford a pizza that'd be cool. but even a joke or uplifting advice would be cool too. thanks. and i hope one day i can return the favour. i live in sk canada by the way.

() pizza is my chemotherapy nausea solution. greetings. my name is melanie, and i'm 28 year old fighting stage 2 hodgkins disease. i'm nearing the halfway point in my treatment. i go for chemotherapy every 2 weeks on a thursday. i spend the weekend sleeping, and my appetite comes back by monday or tuesday.  one of the worst sides effects at that point is a nauseous taste in the back of my throat and strong tastes help me cope. domino's memphis bbq pizza has a strong taste that gives me some relief, and is also the idea balance of high protein/high calorie that my doctors want me to have. i'd really love to have that strong taste when i'm feeling the nausea. this is an ongoing post since every 2 weeks it would be helpful. thank you for your help. 
[] sick in bed and struggling financially... a hot meal would be really nice right now.. i run a struggling small business in southwest ohio. things aren't going so well, but i'm pretty certain once i get a nice clientele they'll ease up.

i live in an apartment with my girlfriend... between the two of us we struggle to pay for food, and suddenly i have a terrible cold (my fever just broke 100 degrees, and i've had fluid in my lungs a couple times... hoping it's not walking pneumonia), meaning working is impossible for me.

on top of that, just before the cold we had a condom break on us, so the money that would have gone to a copay to the doctor's office instead went to buying a morning after pill. i seriously hope it works. we've been trying to get regular birth control for *months,* but all we seem to do is struggle with the insurance company.

just a little good news would be nice. even if it's just "yes i'll buy you a pizza."

edit: i don't have much to offer, but my girlfriend can probably sketch you a little something if you want!

[] hungry sixteen year old dude stuck at school for another hour and a half. i was up until 7am coding a website, had to wake up at 8:30am, resumed coding until 12pm, a friend smoked me down, came down around 3pm, but i couldn't go to class because i was way too tired. i'm now starving and can't go home for another hour and a half. :( then it's another hour before i get home.

anyway, i'll do something for a pizza, if you tell me what you want. :)

that something could include an amazon purchase for you of up to $10.28. i have $10.28 stuck in an mturk account, which i can transfer to a gift card balance and purchase something if you'd like. i don't have a bank account to withdraw it myself. i believe i can turn it into an [online gift card to amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order/ref=gc_dp_conv_order?ie=utf8&amp;casin=b004llikvu&amp;type=email&amp;design=a_generic_white_10_us), if you want $10.28 in amazon credit for some pizza. :)

**edit**: turns out i can not turn it into an amazon gift card. if you'd like me to purchase something for you though, i will. i can't purchase digital downloads, gift cards, subscribe &amp; save, or amazon prime according to the amazon help.

[] michigan, usa - bills have taken a toll, have company and could use a pie and sticks to enjoy the night. this month was rough with a highe than planned electric bill and been paying for 20lb propane to heat our house while we wait for wood and so we had tuna and crackers for brunch... 

needless to say with the girlfriend's sister over tonight we could use a real meal but one we don't have to scrap together, something with ease might do us well. and hopefully we bounce back quick when the money rolls in. 

new to the subreddit, thanks for any help. peace :)
[] washington state i'd like it if i could make my husband feel special about his accomplishment.... so we're waiting out for some money so we can get moved, but today my husband got his ged after three years! i'm so proud of him and he doesn't think it's anything special, but i want to reward him. problem is we're pretty tight for cash after enrolling in college [waiting on loans, yay debt!]. if anyone would be so kind, it would really mean a lot to us.

also just thanks for having such a nice subreddit for people. it's good to know people are getting help. :d
[] art student would love some cheesy goodness in the midst of some hospital visits with family. can do commission in lieu of food.. hey, guys. i know it's going to sound like kind of a sob story, but it's more stressful than sad for me right now. my grandmother died a few months ago, and since then, my grandfather's health has deteriorated rapidly. after weeks of me and my mom alternating between staying with him both at his home and in the hospital and going to my half-time job (an hour away from his house/the hospital he's staying at most of the time), i've had very little opportunity to be able to be home, and tonight is one of the nights i have off. my bank account is in the negative, and nothing aside from some cheese slices and my mother's frozen tv dinners are in the refrigerator.

i'd be more than willing to do some digital artwork with my tablet, or a physical and mail it/scan it in to you for basically anything.

i attempted using the verification system in the sidebar, but i'm not sure if it worked. i think it did, but i dunno.

thank you in advance - you guys are the best!

edit: do one of you know me? i just got an email for a free pizza from papa johns...
[] on my so and mines first movie date we snuck pizza in to the theater. we are seeing the living dead friday and i would love to get to relive this. id love to surprise him with this. thank you guys so much for helping people (and hopefully me)!!!!! [florida, usa]. thank you guys! i hope to get pizza! 
[] i'm a pizza-gluten with a mischievous puppy... he has planned a saucy heist. i found this subreddit from the front-page. great to see it exists. i am a grad-student at mizzou getting my m.b.a. and while money is tight i would never ask for food for that reason, i can afford a mouth-watering pb&amp;j. instead i just wanted to share a pic of the newest member of my family that will hopefully not steal too much of the delicious mana some call pizza! [my pup "memphis"](http://i.imgur.com/ao70i.jpg). if his cuteness strikes you enough to send a pizza my way, so be it.... you're just another one of his victims.

and for all of you pizza lovers out there, i challenge you to find a better pizza than pepperoni, canadian bacon, artichoke hearts, pepper-jack cheese, red peppers, extra cheese, and extra sauce, on sour dour crust.... what's that? you think you can? tell me... 

glutton**   thanks digiteknique, i knew i misspelled it after i submitted but couldn't edit it!
[] unfortunately, i'm on day two without food and i am resorting to desperate measures.. i'm using a throwaway account because i'm pretty embarrassed about asking reddit to buy me food, but i really have nowhere else to turn to. i live alone and i'm currently jobless. i once had a nice amount saved up in the bank, but unexpected expenses and bills have made it impossible for me to get through the rest of the month. the pantry is bare and so are my pockets. literally. i ate my last ramen packet a couple days ago and i just don't think i'm going to be able to make it until november. if there's anybody willing to help me out soon, i would appreciate it. i will return the favor as soon i am able to.

[] me want a pizza pie! aka hungry parents with a fussy baby and an empty fridge in ca, usa.. hello raop!

my fiancé and i have been living on cereal, grilled cheese sandwiches and jello for almost 2 week now. our [fridge](http://imgur.com/pxp9j) is bare aside from the essentials (milk, cheese, bread) and will remain that way until the 3rd. i'm okay with eating this way for a couple more days but my guy is going crazy. he just went off to work with a sack lunch of the usual and made a comment about how his stomach is shrinking and it made me feel bad. i was thinking about a hot meal i can make (for us for when he got home) with what we have but there's not much. plus, i have a fussy baby on my hands. we have an 8 month old who is a high risk infant so she gets a monthly rsv shot to prevent her from getting the nasty virus. she's been a handful since yesterday :(

i've never requested a pizza here before and we aren't really the types to splurge on eating takeout. but if i had the money i'd do it today, as it would raise our spirits. i just got my verification code so if anyone can hook it up i would greatly appreciate it! i would also pay it forward as soon as i'd be able to :)

thanks &lt;3


[] missouri-babysitting. i am babysitting a four and a two year old for one of my best friends. her and her husband are going to hawaii for a long waited much needed honeymoon five years late. her flight was suppose to be tomorrow but that one got canceled and the best option for them was to take a flight a day early. this has but a big burden on me beings tho tomorrow i get my food stamps which is the only reason i said i could watch her children for her, because i feel pathetic not having any food for them. i feel like a horrible aunt.   
[] pizza for a hungry student in alabama. hey guys, i'm just looking for any one to help me make it to next week. i don't get paid until wednesday, but due to a parking ticket ($50! unbelievable) i've been wiped clean of cash. i haven't eaten since thursday, and while i have no problem with just sucking it up until wednesday, i have a test monday and a random act of pizza would really help to get my brain going. 

thanks for even looking at this!
[] will take a picture of anything you ask me to do and post it for a pizza. basically, as the title indicates, i am bored of studying/waiting to fail my finals and am super hungry.  if anyone has a request, i will take a picture of myself fulfilling that request in exchange for pizza.
[] physically unable to shop/cook, a few days from first paycheck. i found out a couple weeks ago that i have rheumatoid arthritis. while i wait to start serious treatment, i'm having to give up just about every focal activity in my life- basketball, yoga, alcohol and long nights out. this is making my move to a new city all the more difficult, as you might imagine.
anyway, i'm hungry, low on food, and too achy to shop and prepare a meal (no real grip function today). i figured it would be worth a shot since i'm just a couple days away from returning the gesture.
[]- it's been a down week... not to mention few years.. i got laid off on monday from my blue-collar job i've had for years. my boss said that it's hopefully a temporary cost-cutting measure,
 and i'll probably be hired back in the fall when production picks up, and i believe him. things always pick back up in the fall.

 i have a little bit of money saved up, but i stress about the long term.
 
for the last year, it's just been me and my 2 wonderful girls, a. (6) and p.(9).  their mom left last year due to with her drug abuse (first perscription opiates, then heroin). after 3 rounds of 28-day 
treatment (one of them court-ordered), i kicked her out... i had to, i couldn't bear to have the girls see her in the state she was in 99% of the time; if not high, then dope-sick and angry. she occasionally will pop up and visit, but i know she's still using.

long story short: my kids aren't exactly starving, but they havent had a pizza night with dad in quite a long time. i'm hoping we can sit on the floor as a family in front of the tv, put in "how to train your dragon", chow down, and forget about stuff for a couple of hours. 

p.s. obvious throwaway, i didn't want to post with my regular account, as i'm a regular poster/commenter, and not a lurker.
[] new jersey. i am requesting a pizza for dinner. my hubby is in the icu unit,.he had a sezuier and hit his head. they had to do emergency brain surgery, he is medical coma. its to early to tell what is going to happen to him. if you cant do a pizza, please sent good thoughts his way .

() paycheck at my part time job is coming late but i'd sure like some pizza right now. i'm a broke college kid working a part time job at kohls and they said something got messed up with the system and i have to wait for my paycheck. i'm haven't been able to buy groceries yet and i'd appreciate a pizza :)
[] screwed by bank of america and an online thief. so i had 100$ taken from my bank account by some fraudulent paypal scammer. bank of america "investigated" twice and are now saying that the transaction was "authorized" setting me back a 100$ i don't have. a pizza would do wonders for my crappy, crappy mood right now. i'm located in philadelphia.
[] bored, hungry and would love a pizza in cary, nc. as the title says, there isn't much going on here in cary this sunday for me. if you've ever been bored to the point of counting the squares on your ceiling, please consider me. when i say there's nothing going on, i truly mean there is nothing going on. a yummy, cheesy pepperoni pizza would definitely break the monotony that is this very boring sunday. thank you.
[] really craving pizza!. only one place delivers to my house, and i don't get paid until thursday. i promise to reciprocate the gracious gifting of pizza on payday, though :)
[] interning a goverment tech job, broke until the 8th, will donate when i have money.. i live in the twin-cities area (mn). if you buy me a pizza, i promise to but a pizza for another redditor once i get paid.

[] having a bad week, broke, would like to eat something other than sandwiches. (palm bay, fl). i'm unemployed and have been chasing after job opportunities... last night i got an im from the president of a company with a promising job opportunity, only he told me that everything would be delayed because of issues with fcc regulations and i wouldn't start until february at the earliest. yesterday my laptop broke and i had to send it in to apple for repairs. this afternoon i broke the mirror on the closet door while putting a box back in the closet. i called around for quotes on a new mirror. it's going to cost me $100 to replace the mirror. i have to do it, as it's my landlady's property. kinda bums me out, but it has to be done.

while it's not necessary, some delicious pizza would cheer me up quite a bit. i'll be able to pay it forward this weekend when i get some money. thank you! :)

[] first date with the girl of my dreams. warning: tl;dr


hey, so after 4 years of knowing this person, i've finally asked out the woman of my dreams to a date this tuesday, and i'm stoked! problem is...i am broke. i'm only in 10th grade and my parents aren't big on lending me money. that's a big downer. however a good buddy of mine has been a redditor for some years now, and he said that what i should do is come here for random acts of pizza. normally, being the internet, i'm unsure how this works or if the internet is a kind-hearted place or not. so...going on my friends word.. can you guys help me with this date? i don't wanna lose her after the first date. thanks reddit!

[tl;dr] i have a first date with a 4 year crush in a few days and my friend reccomended me to ask here for the most romantic pizza dinner by reddit.
[] iowan looking for some pizza. hello, raop. i am currently sitting at my desk at work looking over my checkbook register, sighing at the fact that i have $1.85 left to last me until may 3rd. yesterday i spent my last little bit of money on a birthday present for my daughter, who turns 4 tomorrow. it has also been raining the last week and a half. could really go for a tasty pizza when i get off of work just to cheer me up, and will pay it forward hopefully on the 3rd when i get paid again.

[] bank account is overdrawn, i don't get paid until friday, and i'd love a pizza for dinner. . i have a gluten-allergy unfortunately but domino's makes gluten-free pizza that i don't react to! 

i would appreciate this like crazy and am genuinely planning to pay it forward asap. 
[] i'm a broke college student getting ready for his for day of the semester tomorrow. (boone, north carolina). hey everyone, this is my first time asking reddit for a pizza, or anything for that matter. i'm a 2nd year environmental science major at appalachian state university. i'm asking for a pizza because i've been living off of peanutbutter sandwiches for a bit and a cheesy pizza sounds good. i obviously will live without one, just thought i'd give this try because my friends can't buy me a pizza haha.

after reading other posts, i'd prefer someone who is legitimately starving get a pizza instead, i can enjoy my peanut butter sandwiches a while longer.
[] asheville, studying for finals and hungry.

[] i have eaten ramen 3 meals a day for the last 5 days, can someone please be mind enough to lend a guy some pepperoni? . i really really really hate asking for things, especially from strangers. i lost a bunch of hours on my last check, and have been surviving on the 4 dollars u had left after rent, ramen is nasty. if you want to help someone out, this guy is desperate for some protein. thank you even if you don't help. 


edit. i am in peoria illinois, if that helps. i am also down to walk to your house and clean for food at this point in the day if you live in ptown. 
[] sunderland, uk. have to spend all my money repairing my bike for work, will forward on friday when i get paid.. in a nutshell, 2 months ago i sold my car to cycle to work and yesterday night the rear derailleur of my trek madone sheared off and i crashed into a bus shelter full of kids (no kids were hurt, but they laughed). 

i have to spend my last £60 on repairs whilst nursing a bruised ego.

i only have freezer food until friday and some pizza would go a long way to making me feel better. 


i will forward or pay back as soon as i get paid this friday, promise.

thanks for reading.

[ fl, usa] celebrating early high school graduation.. hey everyone, i graduated early on monday but unfortunately about 3 hours before i was going to celebrate, my best friend called me saying her grandfather died and i've spent the last few days since then comforting her, making sure she doesn't focus on it, etc. this has lead to a lack of celebration and all i really want for graduating is a pizza. so if someone wants to help me celebrate, i'd really appreciate it.

[] i've never felt like anything terrible enough is happening in my life to feel like i deserve a pizza over some of the other people that  here.. orange county, ca. this is *random* acts of pizza not *charitable* acts of pizza, so i suppose it's worth a shot. a pizza tonight would make me insanely happy. i'm drooling over thoughts of gooey cheese... mmmm :)
[] college guy, pretty hungry. would love a pizza for tonight.. i just started classes this week, and i probably won't have any money for a couple more weeks. i'm running pretty low on food and a pizza could feed me for at least a few days. situation's no more complicated than that. when i get some money, i'd love to return the favor.

thanks guys. :)

[] no luck so far with a job hunt. would love something warm for dinner!. i lost my job two and a half weeks ago and have been constantly on the hunt for a new job since then.  i've been living off of family leftovers, pb&amp;j and cereal since then.  i'd love nothing more than something nice and hot for dinner tonight (and the next few nights cause holla, leftovers!) and papa john's has their buffalo chicken pizza on special today.  as soon as i am able, i would be more than happy to pay it forward if someone were so inclined to help me out.  thanks!
() pizza in long beach?. so i've been surviving off bread and soup for a few days and have a few more days of that to look forward to. i don't get off work for a few hours though and all my soup is at home. i only have 3 cans left, so i'm hesitant to even eat them.


would anyone be able to hook up a pizza? any pizza? i had some m&amp;m's today but even making this request is making me salivate.

update: in another thread krayer saw and sent me $7.92 so imma go buy some tuna and cup of noodles. thank you to anyone who read this post but tonight, i dine on canned fish!

edit 2: 1369ic hooked it up a lil more so when possible i shall post a picture of my tuna, bread, and other good eats in place of pizza tonight. 
[] in harrisonburg va (jmu), student pulling an all nighter for final tomorrow. im not broke like many of the others in here, that being said i am on a college student budget and would love a pizza to help pull me through this all nighter i'm starting. good luck to any other student that sees this!
[] today has sucked. today has been awful, i have no money, i got a bill in which i can't pay, i have no food in my house and to top it all off rent is due. a pizza would be amazing right now.
im in londonderry - northern ireland
[] struggling college student with $1.58 to my name. in between paychecks and no food left in the apt. i have been trying to ration the food i had left to last until next week. turns out i miss calculated. i have been out of a job for about 2 months now and just got another one a couple weeks ago, my next paycheck should be enough to cover everything, but until then i'm flat broke and can't even afford the gas to put in my bike to get to work. a nice hot meal other than the ramen ive been eating would be nice right now. any help?
[] my boyfriend's birthday has been a clusterfuck. can someone help me make it better? . long story short, today is my boyfriend's birthday and it has nooooot gone as planned at all. 

it sucks :( i want to take him out for dinner to try to fix this, but can't afford it. broke as hell and i don't get paid until the end of the month.

i live in canada, is anyone willing/able to help me out? something delicious from pizza 73 or panago would go miles towards helping me perk him up and put a smile on his face.

edit: scratch this request, guys. we're passing out now. 
keep calm and pizza on!  
[] virginia, usa- lost (low-paying) job yesterday due to the chronic stress fracture in my foot. so, about a 2 months ago, i found a job. it took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. the rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.

i also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. i was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and i thought it was healed. i could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and i thought i was in the clear.

and then i got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. i did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. i guess my foot just couldn't take it. i got an ultrasound on it two days ago. turns out the fracture has broken again, and i now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. i'm back in a walking boot. the one i have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. this one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.

(i've also figured out that i can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. it's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) 

my boss got really snippy with me when i quit, and i just had to sit there crying for a while after i hung up the phone.

so, i'd love some pizza. i could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that i wouldn't have to stand up to make. it'd be really helpful. as soon as i get a job where i'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, i will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.

sorry for the longwinded-ness, i'm just really not having a good time right now. :(

tl;dr: broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway. would love pizza. would also love to give pizza when i can afford it.
[] fayetteville, ar - need a pizza pick-me-up. life is a hectic mess right now and eating on the cheap has had its merits, but if i eat one more egg or package of ramen i may cry. i've spent my last bit of money on moving to a new town to start fresh on life, and while things are good, i am craving a pizza like whoa.

also, it'd be a bit of a celebration to having a job interview today. the pay increase would help oh so very much, so i'm crossing my fingers! hopefully if the job comes through, i can pay it forward.

thanks! &lt;3
[] orange county, california. i'm pregnant and my ultrasound is tomorrow i could really use a pizza!. i'm really hungry and all my money is going towards my ultrasound tomorrow, pretty please with sugar on top buy me a pizza? i'll send you the ultrasound picture when i found out the gender tomorrow! celebration time!
i'll also loveee you forever. thank youuu.
[]just moved in and debit card isn't here yet,  not starving but broke. my girlfriend and i wouldn't mind a nice pizza - normally i'd have plenty to eat but the bank happens to be closed today so no cash for me :( any takers?  ill be sure to buy someone a pie in the future 

to clarify,  we haven't received our fridge yet either 
[] hi raop, i do not have a financial crisis but i'm having a terrible week and it seems like when it can't get any worse, it does. i would really like to enjoy a pizza today! [66]. a pizza and hopefully a story about your life and how you're enjoying it. just so i know that there are awesome times in life :)

i do live in canada so i'm hoping that's not a problem.
[] jobless, broke, getting sued for $50,000, depressed and anxiety levels through the roof. been craving pizza but can't afford it.. i've never done this before, and i can't imagine anybody would give a stranger a free pizza. but why not give it a shot. 

i just want a night of greasy comfort food. like i said, being sued for 50k, due to a bus accident i caused a year ago in which 14 people were injured (an honest mistake; it was raining, couldn't get out of the way in time, just spun in place). insurance couldn't cover it all. had to empty my bank account to pay for a lawyer, and on top of that i got laid off from my job a few months ago. living with my parents again, and was almost able to move back out, until the accident. back to square one.

i've always had problems with anxiety and depression, and this is really making me crumble. had to stop seeing my therapist due to losing my insurance through my job (called some sliding scale clinics but not taking new patients). it would just be nice to eat some comforting pizza. but i can't afford much. 

thanks for your consideration and for reading this. if you want proof of some kind i'll provide whatever you need; i know it sounds like kind of a fantastic run of bad luck.
[] just moved to idaho. this county has a no franchise law. haven't started working yet and i am desperate for some pizza.. no dominos, pizza hut, alfys, or even papa johns. what am i going to do?!
[] 13 year old girl wants a pizza. spent all afternoon out in the cold because my older sister got in a fender bender.  mom had a tooth pulled and is in too much pain to make dinner.  
[] northern virginia: quit my job, home alone with no money or food, $10 away from a free pizza. hello.

i've been subsisting on tip money for the past couple of days, but i had to quit my job this morning because my manager threatened to fire me if i did not take an 18 hour shift (right after 4 hours of sleep from a 12 hour shift!). i had been working as a cook for a sports bar type place for a week and a half, but i have yet to receive my first paycheck. i quit because i cannot work for a place that does not respect the schedule, forcing me to work unannounced overtime that is often more than the scheduled time itself. i've already filled out applications to 5 places, so i am sure i'll be fine. i'll get my paycheck in the mail on friday or saturday, too.

about me: 19, ems student &amp; highschool grad who no longer has tip money to carry him day to day. i moved back in with my mom from my grandparents house. my grandparents are well-off, but my mother is unemployed and gets food bill from the grandparents. she is visiting my aunt and uncle in canada this week, so no food bill for me until sunday. :(

what i can give in return: if i give you my papa john's credentials, you can order just a $10 pizza to my door and i will have earned 1 free large pizza from their loyalty program. :d
i can either eat it myself or send it back to you! 2 for the price of 1!
i can also chat with you about science, academics, or just politics or really whatever you'd like to talk about. we can connect on tumblr or facebook if you like :3
[] 3 college kids at work looking for a little pizza love. the three of us are here at work at the campus computer repair desk. it's the end of the semester and we're all kind of hurting on cash, and it would be awesome to get a little pizza to share and make sure we aren't wasting an hour of $8/hour pay.

r_a_o_p is awesome, and we'd really appreciate it. i really hate asking for stuff like this, but pizza sounds delicious right now.

thanks for considering us.

[] chicago, il just moved,  
an empty apartment and empty 
stomachs!. my girlfriend and i just moved into our first apartment together, and after a hot weekend of moving and moving related expenses, we're broke and hungry.

we would love to spend our first real night in our new apartmen snugglin' with a pie.
[] just had my wisdom teeth out earlier this week, and moving back into the dorms. i had a room to myself, but now i have a roommate. i just really want some pizza to break the ice.
[] can anyone help?. i don't get paid until wednesday, and my sister and i are reeling from the fact that we just found out our biological father lost his fight with cancer this morning. a pizza or 2 would be a welcome. have a good week.

edit: forgot to put [request] in the title the first time. maybe that's why it didn't show up on the subreddit...
[] i know everyone is mostly going to give to boston but my gaybro and i are broke on a friday night all slone.. we're sitting here chatting and watching the news to distract us from our hunger. gratitude.
what ever you can give is greatly appreciated

[]boyfriend says i'm on my own for dinner with no money in the bank until friday. anybody willing to buy me dinner?. so where he works he somehow got free pizza for dinner and texted me i was on my own. i told him to bring me some and he said he can't...they ate it all. :(  i'm in sherwood arkansas and thought i might give this a try. think it might make him laugh if i get a pizza too. :) 

edit: ok cancel this request. a friend called me and if going to take me out to dinner. :)
[] not looking for "free" pizza, just a quick pay it forward until monday. (pittsburgh). well, it's thursday and i am hungry. we get paid on the 15th of every month at my job, and when i looked when i paid all my bills for the first half of the month, i thought the 15th was a sunday which means we would have got our paychecks tomorrow (friday since they do not direct deposit on the weekend).

the first half of the month always kills me in bills so i know to be tight with money until i get paid next...well, i didn't expect to not have any money all weekend. whoops. it is totally my fault though, since i totally looked at the wrong date. derp.

anyways, just looking for some dinner tonight that will last over into breakfast/lunch tomorrow, but i am not poor or needy by any stretch of the imagination, **so that means that if there is someone else posting that sounds as if they need this pizza way more than me, please for the love of cheese give it to them over me!**

i just want to get a pizza today and pay for it once i get paid, so that means if you buy me a pizza, come monday you can (read: **you gotta do it man**) pm me saying *hey, i bought you that pizza on thursday, i want my pizza back now bitch."* and you'll have a pizza sent right to your door!

or, if you're feeling x2 times as generous, email me a link from raop that you chose and feel is needing a pizza, and i'll randomly send them a pizza. pretty much, i feel shitty asking for a pizza tonight because it is just piss poor planning on my part with my pay, so i'd love to just give the pizza back to you next week or give it to someone else you deem is worthy.
[]alone on a saturday night, will make you a cool drawing, or send kitty pics! (ma/us). the roommate's out, the boyfriend's having a night with his friends.  i'm a week away from turning 22 with no job and no social life (which is good i guess, because i'd be enticed to eat out more).  my family pays me to clean houses for them, but that $100 i make goes straight into groceries (now eaten twice as fast since the bf decided to save money buying lunch at work by having me cook when he's over; i don't mind, but he hasn't contributed much to the grocery bill) and gas.  i'm feeling pretty down tonight, but i'm not the worst off.  i have food in my apartment, and a car that runs.  but i figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.
anyone wanna float me a slice?  i'll draw just about anything you want.  i can do some half-decent portraits, manga was my old hobby, i can make some mlp characters... :p  all by hand, colored, for you.  or i can send you pics of my roommate's cat and my cat.

[] something to keep me going while i look for a second jorb.. i'm a 22 year old student out of topeka, ks, majoring in accounting and finance. i am currently on the hunt for a 2nd job that'll pay for tuition, books, and the other expenses life presents me. as my current job barely covers rent and utilities, food has kinda taken a back seat for me. i know i'm new on here, but i have been a long time member on other web sites like slickdeals.net, which showed me how to save money on groceries thru amazon.

i am hitting up a temp agency today to see if i can find an immediate solution to my money quandaries. if i am successful in supplementing my income, i will gladly return to do my part in keeping the wheel of pizza graciousness spinning. my birthday is coming up on the 14th of july, and i have always felt more comfortable with giving than receiving on my special day. like a hobbit.

it would be such a blessing to not have to worry about where my next couple meals are coming from.
{} if somebody could provide the cheapest pizza possible in the area for me and a hungry friend.. all you have is my word, for what its worth from a stranger on the internet but i have a guaranteed free pizza coupon code this sunday and am willing to send it to you in exchange. we would really appreciate a pizza or any food for that matter.
[] i'm a terrible cook and would love a pizza. **miami, fl**

i've never tried this raop before, but i thought i'd give it a shot. i've had a shitty week at work, burnt myself trying to cook, and in the end i couldn't really eat it. here's some [proof](http://i.imgur.com/tegji0e.jpg).

a small pan pizza from domino's sounds amazing right now, but i won't be picky! i'll even pick up at the store to save on the delivery fee.

thanks in advance!

[] drunk, playing starcraft ii, want pizza. 
[] bank account frozen-no food in the house-spent last bit of money on formula for my son.. my bank account is frozen due to 'suspicious activity' which is a mistake on the bank's part but they said there's nothing they can do for 5-6 days on top of that the electricity in my apartment just got turned back on due to a power line getting struck a few days ago and all of the food in my fridge is bad now. i was planning on shopping tonight but with my account frozen, i can't. 

i spent the last bit of money i had on-hand to buy my 4 and a half month old son some formula and put some gas into my car. a pizza would do wonders for me tonight. 

i'll gladly pay it forward when my bank account becomes unfrozen 
[] student in austin would be grateful for dinner. hello. this is my novelty account in place of my real 2-year one. people have quickly forgotten about this masterpiece of a book. i decided not to perpetuate anything to do with palin anyway.

i've never asked the internet for assistance, so be gentle with me. i live in austin and i don't have too much longer on my degree. i had a work-study job, but since i'm not taking summer classes, i don't anymore. i have $4 to get me through the week. if some nice guy or gal could send a pizza my way, i'd be blown away. two mediums could feed me for 3 days

as a token of my gratitude, i could send you a picture of me and said pizza or write a paragraph for you in an interesting foreign language (which i will keep secret for now ;) ). 

thank you.
[] south florida. parents are out for the week and the house is lacking a vital component. pizza.. sitting here with myself, my two sisters, and my elder sister's boyfriend. we've been cooking our own meals the past few nights, but today i'm thinking pizza. parents are coming home soon and we gotta start cleaning up.
[] my campus' dining closed down. . my school is opened these last two days (monday and tuesday) for finals even though a lot of people had most of theirs last week. my friend and i have an exam on tuesday, so we haven't been able to go home early. but what i don't get is why all the food shut down without a prior notice. i've been living on meal swipes this semester, but now their useless and i'm broke, so no going out to eat. i just need a pizzaaaa.
[]- oklahoma, hurting for the sauce man.... i am exhausted after work, and hungry, however, i spent the last of my money buying reddit gold for people the other night. that's my own fault though. anyways, if you're in a pizza giving mood, i'm in a pizza receiving mood. also, does anyone know how to make an x-mas present seamless when wrapping it? it keeps buckling..

edit: don't need it anymore! roommate came home with that little caesars! 
[] too broke for much of anything. can't even do what makes me happy.. i've never done this and i should probably use a throwaway, but whatever. i've been unemployed, again, for a few weeks now and my unemployment checks are less than half of what i was making when i was working. i've applied to over twenty jobs in the past month and only one has even gotten back to me to say that they had found someone better suited. all of my bills and rent are/were late, i can barely afford enough food, and, to top it off, i can't even go snowboarding....which is truly the only thing that keeps me sane in the winter. all of my friends are snowboarders and most of them are out riding tonight. i'm not saying a pizza would cure the shit that's going through my head, but i could definitely use one to help restore some optimism in my life.
edit: i know i'm not in the worst of shape with where i'm at, but i do battle with some very strong depression from time to time and right now is one of those times. also, i'd always rather give than receive and bringing myself to ask for help is one of the hardest things for me to do.
[] houston, tx. finally made the decision to go to college after taking a year off. just spent all of my money on books and tuition classes... community college in the summer and full time in the fall at uh! i'm pretty hungry and to be honest, i'm kinda scared that the remainder of the money in my account won't be enough to get me to work till next paycheck...pizza would be awesome right now!

 - pizza for three. i dont get paid until tomorrow, and we have nothing to eat for dinner. my 5 and 7 year old really love pizza and it would be a great surprise for them to have pizza for dinner. so a ecard would really be helpful cause i can order around dinner time and surprise my babies with pizza.

[] london, canada. it'd be really nice to have a hot meal delivered.. it's summer, i'm a student, and i'm broke for the next week or so. it would be really, really nice to have a hot meal delivered to my doorstep. i'd repay the community once my student loan comes in, but until then i'm getting kind of sick of ramen.

[] unemployed but looking, nothing but a zucchini and condiments in the fridge. atlanta, ga area. so i currently have $3 in my bank account and a job's been hard to come by with every place i've been to being fully staffed due to the holiday season.  if anyone is feeling particularly generous, i'd greatly appreciate a pizza to live off of for a couple days.

i could really use a pizza right now.

[] separated from the military in august, in between jobs. could really use a bite to eat.. i'm not complaining or anything, i'm sure i'll get back on my feet soon, but as it is i'm broke as a joke (-95.47 in the bank), couch surfing, and hungry as hell. i could really use something to keep me from losing it here.

[] syracuse, ny.  need to get through the next 9 days with $12 for food and gas.... my next paycheck wont come til friday the 16th.  until then i have exactly $12.88 in my account to get gas to get me to work and food.  a pizza could easily feed me for 3+ days :)  i had an unexpected illness which left me out of work for some time and my job does not compensate for sick time.  anyone willing to help a guy out?  i will be sure to pay it forward when i get back on my feet financially!
[] just having a bad week. i've been emotionally rocky the last few days.  being around people has been very upsetting to me the last few days, i just got off work about an hour and a half ago and had to immediately find a quiet spot outside to break down for half an hour.  i'm sure this is just stress, i moved/graduated/got a new job recently and don't have any close friends in my new area yet (besides a college friend who thankfully moved to this area too).

i'm taking the night off to stay in and heal.  it would be awesome to be able to nibble on a pizza while doing so.  promise i'll pay it forward in the near future.
[] for a pizza (duh). my friends seem to doubt that this sub actually serves its purpose.

[][us, il] my current plans for my feast to watch the blackhawks win the stanley cup consists of ramen and frozen veggies. would love a warm pie!. like the title says, i plan on eating some ramen and frozen veggies, but a nice pizza would be great. papa johns is close by, but i don't think either of the other big companies can deliver. 
[] this has been the worst day of my life, a pizza would be a nice band-aid. st pete, fl. i cant pay my bills, much less pay for food. ive been eating thanksgiving leftovers everyday, which is pretty good eating. at least its not ramen noodles or toast everyday. but i feel the cheezyness could raise my spirits enough to get thru the rest of the year.

the favor would surely be forwarded when i get back up on my feet.

luvs ya, fellow redditors.
[] no money left to our names... needing dinner ready for fiancée to come home to from work...please help if you can!. my fiancée is very hungry. she has had a really bad day at work. i want to be able to have something for her to be able to come home to that's good to eat, and be able to cheer her up. we're both beyond broke and no food left in our house.

i was wanting to try to get us a large pizza. her favorite is meat lovers, but we'd greatly appreciate any kind. we live in kentucky. as soon as we can get back on our feet, i promise to pay this forward and help someone that is in the same dire straits that we are currently going through.

if anyone would like pictures of us, we'll be glad to provide. also, if there is anything you'd like to ask me, ask away. i'm open to just about any questions.

thanks raop'ers!
[] central massachusetts, have $2 to my name until thursday, very hungry :/. so, my brother and his g/f just moved out of our apartment a couple weeks ago, and it's been great having the place to myself until i can get a new roommate... unfortunately, it's left me also having to pay rent and bills entirely on my own.. which, as of this week, has left me with $2 in my bank account, no more food in my fridge, and a really big appetite, since i've had (literally) nothing but ramen for the last two days.

i would really appreciate any help, and if this works out, when i get paid on thursday, i'll make an [offer] thread to try and pay it forward.

thanks in advance!!
[] homeless student in need of food to hold him over for a bit. hey, i don't normally do this kind of thing, but it would really help me right now. i have found myself to be recently homeless with no food or money, and being that i am hypoglycemic, i probably should do something about it. if anyone could send me a pizza, i could make it last me several days and it would keep my glucose levels at least somewhat stable. this is a temporary situation and i intend to get back onto my feet, but for now i am in need of any kind of help i can get. i would greatly appreciate it.
[] we're running out of boxes of spaghetti to eat :(. so here is my family's story: girl meets boy, they fall in love, get married, have teh cutest baby in the world! somewhere along that path girl starts working for scumbag corporation. when it comes time for maternity leave as the lil' redditor is close to being born, scumbag corporation says 'don't worry, all of your benefits will continue, you'll get paid leave, have fun with teh baby cuddles.' 

well, we really wish it had worked out like that :( i took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to fmla. 7 weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. my insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while i was on leave, even though i was assured they'd continue. when i got back to work two weeks ago i fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time i was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. that adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! they are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. they are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. 

luckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and i are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. we'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven. as soon as we get caught up financially, which according to my strict budget won't be until late november, i plan on doing the same for another redditor in need! 

tl,dr; my company is basically making me pay for my maternity leave after the fact, to the sum of $2400. we can't afford groceries because of this right now and would just love one night where we can have the luxury of a pizza. thanks!
: hungry in madison, wi. can someone please help? . i'm not due to go back to my job until next week. i've been off for hand surgery. i'm broke, my temporary food stamps have run out until the 10th, and my parents can't put $20 into my account until the bank re-opens tuesday (monday is a bank holiday). can someone please help?

also, this account is a throwaway. i'm embarrassed and i don't want my friends to see. i will be happy to give you my other user name and pm you from that account for proof. thanks for reading. 
[] cousin screwed me over (accidentally) and cost me the last of my money for the week.. my cousin about a week ago tried to change my oil in exchange for letting him use my car to drive to work. since mn has pretty good metro transit, i use that to get to and from class every day.

cue friday when i finally had to use my car. oil light is on. check the oil. there is no oil. he messed up the oil filter and everything leaked out. had to spend the only money i had left (until tomorrow) fixing it.  could use a pizza tonight. my other option is to use the couple bucks i have to buy mcdonalds, but then not be able to take metro transit and therefore miss class. 

let me know if you want to help out! i will definitely pay it forward next week. :)
[] n. california, 2 young men who love pizza.. i hope i did everything right. my deal is no better or worse than most people here. i live in a decent place with a room mate, both jobless at the moment and going to school. both on food stamps. i have a 2 1/2 year old daughter that most of my ebt goes to, which is fine. problem is both of our cards are empty but mine gets refilled in a week. i have exactly one cup of noodles left, half a bag of pork rhines, a full jug of apple juice and possibly 3 sandwiches worth of bread for peanut butter and jelly. honestly, we don't eat much. if one of you was so kind as to offer even one pizza, it would be very appreciated. i'll take a picture, thank you, anything. thanks for considering.
[] a pizza ,, help?? get me a  e- giftcard or something please... north jersey..passaic county. well i decided to ask one of my friends, and he was nice enough to get me pizza tonight :)

but that or pizza hut one is good for me. 


[] the 2 1/2 month old is eating but we are not!. i'm 23 years old. my husband is 20. we live in ohio right now and i do work but it's barely paying the rent. we applied for food assistance just until we can get on our feet but they said it can take up to 30 days just for a decision. my husband can't work right now and i'm trying so desperately to find work on the side to feed us and pay for his immigration. see, me and my hubby met online in a dragonball z chatroom when we were young teenagers and we fell in love. he is canadian and anyone out there who fell in love with someone in another country understands that it's an expensive process. we're both depressed. me because i can't do more. and him because he can't work and support his family. we're making progress but slowly. we also have a 2 1/2 month old son. he is eating (and quite well if i were to be honest.. he's a little chow hound!) we've been living on ramen noodles and those cheap 99.9 percent water meats and bread. we don't even have ketchup or mustard anymore. the pepper is gone, the salt is almost there. will take a picture of our fridge and cupboard if desired. we don't even have a tree and zero family in the area. i would probably start crying if someone actually helped.. i'm tearing up now lol.. anyways that's our story. would totally appreciate it and god bless you all anyways.
[] no food, no car, and an empty apartment building.... so, i'm apartment sitting for a friend of mine, in college park md, and since it's summer, the college-apartments are pretty much empty. and i'm broke, with no car, so i can't buy food and even if i could i'd have no way to get there. r/raop, can you help?
[] having a depressing month, would be grateful if someone sent me pizza so i can eat something other than rice and spaghetti . throwaway for obvious reasons.

i have been having such a terrible month. my parents don't do anything, they don't clean, they don't cook, they just yell and yell. i've always put on a plastic smile, but something snapped. i ended up crying to my friends house in the rain, and i was taken to the hospital.

i ended up staying at the psych ward for nine days, the doctors wanted to keep an eye on me. they prescribed some anti depressants, but my parents refused, saying that they don't think the medicine will work!

now i came back to my house, nothing really changed. the only thing we eat is the food my brother and i cook, rice and spaghetti, and the terrible foods my mom gets from the restaurant she works at.

i'm not begging for a pizza, but i really would like one? i'll try to pay back if i can, i just need some comfort food, i haven't had any pizza for a long time, and it would really help me cope with all of this. 
[] ok- mama stuck at home with the baby; would love some pizza for lunch!. fiance took the car seat base, so we have no way of leaving our apartment today. since we're stuck, it'd be nice to get a decent lunch delivered. thanks for considering us!

[] bellevue, ohio: disabled brother and 5 kids could use a smile. i just have no money at all to help them but they could really use an unexpected happy moment! we have rice and beans and will not starve,but the kids honestly hate the same meal again and again. i will have the oppurtunity to pass the pizza along in a couple weeks when things have grown more stable here. not sure how exactly to verify as i have no camera but please feel free to message me!
[] spent the last of my money paying the veterinarian for my kitten, no food for the rest of the week . hey guys, i just got back from the vet after my kitten had an accident, poor guy broke his paw. i don't earn much and scrap by every week with my food budget and the veterinarian bill really set me back this week. if someone here could help me out it would really put my mind at ease. thanks for reading, here's a pic of the little [guy](http://imgur.com/nze6x)

[] vancouver canada - starting a new job on monday, could use something to eat. hello fellow redditors,

i lost my job earlier this month, and my pockets are near empty. i'm fortunate to have landed a decent job, but my stomach is grumbling and i'm almost out of bread. it isn't a completely desperate situation, but if anyone is willing to help me out i couldn't thank them enough. i could send you a small painting or sculpture when i'm able to cover shipping and all that, if that interests you.

thanks for reading

[] going to be completely honest. . my family wants a pizza. my husband, my 3 yr old daughter and i are really craving a pizza right now. we don't have the money to get it and we are living on low income. i'm not giving anyone here a sob story. there's no point. it's not going to help my situation anymore or less if people know my whole life story. like i said, i am just going to be completely honest. we are all craving a pizza :) we have a papa johns around here, we love pepperoni and their little cups of garlic sauce!!

:) want something in return? a drawing, poem, song, ?!
[]long week with our cat tula-kansas. i know sappy stories are sometimes made-up or used to take advantage of people.  i hate to admit it, but this sappy story is true.  today, my wife and i lost our youngest cat tula to liver failure (that is assumed, waiting on the official results).  we rescued her 2 years ago after a fox attack her in the wild.  the vet was going to put her asleep , but my wife, the lover of most living creatures convinced me to take her in.

this week she refused food and eventually last evening passed away.  my wife did get to see her thursday, but she looked "vacant".  we both agreed we would donate her to the local university for them to perform the autopsy and possibly see what caused her liver to fail.

i am asking for her for some pizza from the reddit community.  this is really for my wife because of the attachment that she had with her.  i can provide verification of tula and the autopsy (when we get it).  but pizza and bread sticks would cheer up my wife.

thanks for at least reading this.  i will pay it forward sometime soon down the road.

[] unemployed recent college grad in los angeles . i recently graduated from uc san diego with a ba in theater and now i'm trying to break into the industry in la. i've been here for 6 months now and have had some luck with odd jobs, but no steady work. a pizza for my gf and i would be greatly appreciated.
[]  something to get me by for a few days.   just looking to add a little food to the fridge in the form of leftovers.  i deleted a request because i requested a few times over a few days, unsuccessfully.  i should have planned for this, but i didnt and now i dont know where to turn for help.  i am in the process of finding assistance from an agency of some sort. i have never been in this position before, i am trying to adjust as best i can.

[ and offer!]. hey guys! i've been craving pizza lately, and have enough money to buy for myself but i figured in the spirit of raop, i need to give back. so here's the idea i'd like to pitch:

i'm willing to send cookies (of your choice!! although i've been keen on making some bacon choco chip ones lately) to the sender of my pizza, and another random person (or maybe 2. or 3. probably from [/r/randomacts of cookies](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofcookies/)). i've also got some ideas on how to send cupcakes that i'd like to try as well. i'm a pretty damn good baker so i hope this attempt of "paying it forward" is sufficient. 
i should also mention i'm in b.c., but willing to ship anywhere! 
() u.s.  i guess i don't have a sad story.... nope, no sad story, i'm just looking for a pie.  
[] a pizzah in toronto :]. just finished the last of my exams recently and while looking for full time employment could use some pizza :] .

anything is appreciated. thank you for your time

[]broke london student rationing 2 tuna cans over 4 days. i am a longtime lurker and have made people into redditors

i have just finished an exam(a level's) and have spent all my money on a travelcard for the week (more exams on tuesday and thursday).
i live alone and do not get any money until friday(part time bar work).

[] selden, ny - phone is lost. sadface . buy me a cheese pizza?
[] not starving, broke or homeless. just curious.. basically just heard about this sub from a friend and the idea kinda blew my mind. "who the hell gives out free pizza to complete strangers?" might have been my exact response.

there is literally nothing wrong with me or my living conditions except my roommate wanted to keep his tv on all of last night at what i can only assume was max volume. after like 30 minutes of trying to sleep, i got up to turn it off and he was already asleep. i gave him a look that said, "really, bro?" but he obviously didn't pick up on it. he then woke up again at some point, turned it on again and promptly went back to sleep. i slept in for my first class. but he's a really nice guy otherwise, probably.

so yeah, i'm here in buffalo, ny and there is literally nothing wrong with my life except that i'm in buffalo, ny. but i would definitely appreciate a random pizza nonetheless. 
[] no sob story here.. hey redditors. i'm going to be hanging out with a couple of friends tonight and watching a movie. i've been off work sick for a while now and don't really have the spare cash for pizza currently. i'm not really struggling or starving. i just like pizza and haven't had any in a while. i would enjoy it greatly. 
[] austin, tx, student, broke and craving pizza. haha true. culinary student with a pretty sad looking fridge at the moment, could use some pizza in a temporary time of need!
() broke college student who loves pizza. hello random acts of pizza! im a poor college student and just came across this subreddit, im going to valencia community college near ucf in orlando and i was hoping to eat a warm pizza tonight. theres not much in my pantry, a couple boxes of ramen and thats about it.

i was a video game tester for 3 years for electronic arts but got laid off 7-8 months ago and havent been able to find a job since. if you have any questions about being a video game tester id be happy to answer them for you, i know it interests a lot of people

thank you in advance!
[]famished (florida). i made a request yesterday and sadly i got no response. unfortunately i am still out of food and was hoping today i would have better luck. here is the original thread i started http://www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza/comments/i6oek/requestran_out_of_food_please_help/

any help would be awesome. 
[]ks. still waiting for unemployment to come through, had to pawn our stuff for bills and still don't have enough money for food.. things have been hard. my wife and i worked for the same company and both got laid off about a month ago. our unemployment still hasn't been approved and today we had to pawn our tv, game system and guitars so that we could pay bills. after putting gas in the car we don't even have enough left for some food. a pizza or two would help lift our spirits.
[] in between eviction and finding a new place, could really use your help! (san diego). got evicted a few weeks ago due to my dad and i (we're roomates) falling upon difficult financial times. thanks to the generosity of some friends, i've had a place to stay for the last 2 weeks.

however, things are getting really tight as i wait for my next paycheck to be deposited (the 5th). i already feel overextended with the friends who have been lodging me, and would prefer not to have to ask them for money/food as well.

if there are any redditors out there who are in a position to help, i would be extremely grateful and will do my best to reciprocate the favor. a pizza will most definitely get me through to my next paycheck and keep me afloat. verification code / address / pics / anything else you want available upon request!

i'm very grateful to even have a place to ask for help, so thank you very, very much.

 [] rough weekend. low on funds until payday. could use a pizza.. i've got some food to hold me over until friday if i'm creative w/ my meals but i've only got $10 in my wallet and anything left in the bank is going in my tank to get to work. i've had a rough weekend and i could use a pizza tonight. i'll pay it forward on payday.
[]at a [5] and feeling the munchies, a pizza would be nice.. pretty much what the title says. felt a little stress from the weekend (relationship problems), so i decided to unwind a little bit with some weed. now i'm feeling the munchies and i realize that i've got no food in the house, and i'm not okay to drive to go out and get money or anything. a pizza would be very appreciated. located on the east coast of the us, thanks for your time. any ents here?
[] just for fun, help turn my lackluster day around. just thought i'd give this a shot and see how it works. i live out near boston, ma. i am a little sick of sustaining myself on ramen and pasta though so some pizza would be an amazing treat.
[] need help. my two roommates and i are out of food and money until friday. we have been eating bread with ketchup the past two days and are finally out of bread. anything would be appreciated. 
[] everything is going down hill and i'd like to eat tonight. -cincinnati- . my husband is an ice cream man making 25% commission. i'm currently jobless waiting to hear back from a temp service. my husband works his ass off for free pretty much, because he cannot find a job not even through the three temp services in our area. when he first started this job he was making amazing money. but things slowed down extremely. he went from bringing home $100-$200 a night to $15 or less a day. he also has to pay for gas which is $15 a day. so as you can see he's not making money at all right now.
    the only reason why he is staying with this job, is because the owner is making him co-owner next year and also letting him stock vending machines so he'll be making two salaries. so my husband is trying to keep whats best for our future in mind. 
  however i'm in starvation mode, i've lost 4 pounds in one week due to not eating. i've been snacking around the pieces of moldy bread, hoping for my husband to have a good day and hoping i hear back from the temp service that is suppose to be contacting me back.. i just called my husband and he's only at $60 (he makes 25% of that, which will be used for gas ) and he's going to be heading back to the shop in 20 minutes. so it's another bad day. my stomach is killing me. it would mean everything if someone could help out.
     i'm posting from an alternative account because i communicate with far away friends and i don't really want people to know how much we're failing right now. i wont hesitate to give proof, my username, pictures of my cabinets and refrigerator, facebook name, etc. i'm just extremely hungry, it feels like everything is just crashing down and it sucks.
[] i will do anything for food.. i am very starving at the moment and i have nothing to eat i am willing to do anything for food, please help.

() - austin, tx - i'm sick and broke, but i'm hungry - a hot pizza would help some!. i'd really appreciate it :).. i have $3 for 2 weeks.  there is a pizza hut very close by me, but i'm not picky :)
[] pizza for an oregon college student. i am a college student at oregon state university, and i am studying all day for my  finals this coming week. a hot pizza pie would make my day because there is no better food to study with. i do have some food in my fridge so i am in no way in danger of starving without this pizza, but it would brighten my otherwise dull next couple of days of pure study. i would be sure to pay it forward after my finals and when  i have extra cash i can spend.

thanks for reading reddit :)

[] no family, or friends this year for thanksgiving. moved to ca, it's hard out here, looking for work, planning on ramen tomorrow for thanksgiving because it's all i have currently.  roomate drank all my milk so it's water for me!

i live with a sociopath downstairs that refuses all human contact, an elderly lady that is the owner of the house is going with family.  i came to the west coast to chase my childhood dream of becoming a game designer! i posses a b.s. in game development from brown college in mn where i overpaid for it.  i am currently relying on it contracts that are very slow coming through and honestly i was not prepared for bus transfers costin $6.00 per ride from here to the nearest metropolitan city.  

i know three people out here, the mountains are beautiful, the ocean is breathtaking, and the way people smoke marijuana in the streets free of law enforcement harassment is still a bit of a culture shock for me to see.  

i don't expect a pizza, because every post i make on reddit i get a cynical post right away and a dozen downvotes.  but if somebody reads this and knows what it feels like to be alone on thanksgiving i'll feel accomplished i guess.  

edit: to replace text with "the west coast"
[] minnesota. life sucks :(. i'm just having the greatest of days. my phone's been shut off due to lack of payment, i ran out of gas on the way home from work today, been working for the last 6 days and i still don't get paid until friday. looking at the last two bricks of ramen that i have left makes my heart sink. could anyone make my heart soar again? i would be willing to pay forward a pie after pay day 7/1/11
[] starving musicians in ohio would love you for a pie. hey guys, my roommate/partner in rhymes lost his job yesterday and i've been unable to find work for months.  we've no money (at all) for at least another few days and we're down to three potatoes.  these boys are heavily craving some za to break the monotony and lift our spirits a bit.
thanks in advance to anyone wishing to send some good karma our way!
{} orlando, fl-bit down on my luck.. recently i lost my job, so money has been a bit tight. the other day, my crappy car overheated and blew my gasket. so yesterday i had to put all my money towards a new car, and now i'm too poor for food really. i know this is my first post here, but it's worth a shot haha.
[] help me ring in 21?. today is my birthday and i would love - more than anything - to have some pizza with my friends. i go to the university of texas at arlington. i don't really plan on doing much today aside from chilling and hanging out with my friends. i know that there are other people who are more deserving than me, but it's worth a shot to ask, right? not really asking for much. anything you can offer would be amazing. if not, at least go give someone else something! thanks everyone!
pizza  for walnut, ca  (close to covina, diamond bar, rowland heights). a pizza tonight would be absolutely wonderful, but i'm on a beans and rice budget until i can finally find a new means of employment. i reside in walnut, california. we have a local pizza hut, and there's a domino's and a papa johns just down the street from my place. i'll gladly accept absolutely anything, from anywhere. even something as simple as plain cheese would be awesome. i'm a cheap date. 

this is my first time posting here, so i'm not entirely sure how this works. i'll keep tabs on my post over the course of the next hour or two in the hope it's seen by anyone willing to help. in return i can either pay it forward when i can, or order a pizza for you down the road once i'm back on my feet. thanks in advance  :)

*edit - i know, i know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. i'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even domino's sounds great right now. but i don't have a preference between the three. whatever is the cheapest still works for me. 

*edit 2 - if you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, i'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. i'm still unsure how this all works....am i supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via pm? 

*edit 3 - well, this isn't getting any attention and my stomach is gurgling all the same, so i'm just going to scrounge for the evening. short of a miracle in the job department i'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great. 

() out of work mom. just down on my luck.  i lost my job and am struggling  to make ends meet. the kids and i would love some pizza. i will also pass it along once i am on my feet. i tried this before but no luck lol  umm dont know what else to say.  happy 4th of july!  i hope this works this time, but if not i understand there are many in need and i think this board is a great idea and hope it stays around a long time. you ppl are truely nice ppl and i wish you all the best.
[] college student alone over break and broke.. i'm staying at college for most of winter break to work. i haven't gotten my paycheck yet because of a coworkers error in submitting timesheets. i currently have $0.03 in my bank account. i'd much rather enjoy pizza that will last a couple of days instead of ramen again. thanks!
[] ontario, canada gluten free pizza would settle well in my wife and i's tummies for an evening of playing "amnesia dark decent". we're not picky, as long as there's not fish on it.  i can eat like a tank, but i can curb my appetite - i don't want to make you go broke on a request :d.

[] broke till the 1st, then hoping to grant someone elses pizza wish. hi, i'm new here obviously, found this through a random acts of kindness group i participate in.  my family has had a rough patch the last few months, we had some friends stay with us for what was supposed to be a couple weeks but turned into a couple months where they took advantage of us and basically left us in a really bad place financially because they broke our furniture, took almost all of our childrens toys and really didn't help pay for anything except about $600 in groceries a month when they were a family of 6 not very small people.  needless to say though we're in the last week of the month and our kids have been troopers through all this and we'd really like to get them a special pizza treat but only have $4 to our name.  my husband and i have 2 beautiful kids a 6 year old girl and 2 year olf boy. starting next month we'll also have my 9 year old stepson and hopefully by then we will have finished recovering financially from all this.  thank you ahead of time and we look forward to giving the gift of pizza to someone else who could use it or needs it on the first. we are in colorado.

my family has recently been on a healthy food kick. i'm all for eating healthy, but i like to indulge every once in a while. they're not a fan of doing that. i'd go to the store and get something, but whoops no license. i'd order a pizza, but i have about ten bucks to my name and i have plans for that money. so just pm me if you want to send a pizza to a guy in central florida. 
[] ny broke, hungry but had my first aa meeting today. hey all, just want to tell someone about my breakthrough. i had a drinking problem for a long time and decided to do something about it. today i had my first meeting and it really helped talking about it. i'm kind of in a bad place right now financially and quitting the booze is the best thing right now. if anyone could help out with some pizza i would really appreciate helping me take my mind off the booze and money problem. thanks all.

[] i am broke, have applied for dozens of jobs, and don't restart my job at my university until the fall. will reciprocate in the future!. a few weeks ago my head gasket unexpectedly warped and repairs wrecked my savings for the summer. i had been prepared to remain unemployed until i return to school in the fall, but at the moment i'm operating on a shoestring budget and scrambling for jobs. i've been able to pay my rent, utilities, and internet, and buy cheap staples like eggs and pb&amp;j stuff. ever since i repaired my car, my boyfriend and i have been applying for jobs diligently, 5 or 6 a day, but yesterday my check engine light came on after some trouble accelerating from a stop sign. i haven't driven it again and i'm at my wits' end. i wouldn't have repaired the head gasket initially, except we don't live near enough to grocery stores where our food stamps stretch the whole month to live without a car. in the meantime...we'd just love a slice. additionally, when i get my first paycheck in the fall - sometime in october - i will pm you, and buy you pizza. i am a man of my word. i also plan to frequent this subreddit after every payday from now on because i honestly never thought i'd be here. thanks, reddit. :)

[] just another broke college student. i'm not really sure how this works. what i need to tell you and such. i went out of the country last year, spent all my money, moved back into my old house with my roommate. but ever since i've had the hardest time getting back on top of my money. i had 2 jobs, but i decided recently to quit one and just move back in with my parents. i've got about 2 weeks left in this house, me and my friend who also doesn't have anywhere to stay live in this room. so now all my money goes towards paying off past due bills and people i owe money too, all ive got in the kitchen its canned soup and fruit. which is food, but its almost worse than eating ramen everyday, like a awful liquid diet. 
but whatever, i'm not gonna complain. i thought i'd see if theres anyone who'd like to share a pizza with me and my roommate sometime? where located in memphis. i suppose you pm me for the rest of the details.
[] bank just screwed me over, was planning to buy a pizza but now i can't afford it.. my father just recently was a wealthy man with a high paying job at a bank, but because he took a loan from a client he got fired. my step-mom is jobless, filing for bankruptcy, and i work at mcdonalds to have my own money. unfortunately, i've been screwed over twice in the same day yesterday... my paycheck only clocked me for 8 hours where i deserved to be clocked 16, and the bank would absolutely not allow me to deposit or cash my check. so that leaves me without gta v(which i had planned to buy yesterday), as well as without money in general. i had planned to buy a large pizza to share with my friends while we played gta v but now none of that is possible. my friend brought his hard copy over to my house, and so now i request a random act of pizza be given to us. note: this isn't a sob story, this is just a request so please don't feel guilty if you don't want to give us pizza. i have cereal. 

tl;dr wasn't able to get gta v or pizza, so i'm asking for a random act of pizza. much appreciated.

the kids and my wife would love a nice hot meal we are in walking distance to a pizza hut [they do take out only] a dinner deal box would be best. we have three children,my wife and myself.

[] albuquerque - been down on life lately...never ed anything like this before. lately life just seems like there's no hope in sight...at a weird point in life. i left the girl of my dreams because my mom got sick with cancer and had to return to my hometown from living with her in japan. i get home, shit's fucked up, i can't do anything, she breaks up with me. i ended up going back to school to try and get a worthwhile degree (engineering, go figure) and thus spend all my time studying. i also have to work because i come from a fairly poor family and need to pay for an apartment close to campus (not to mention there's no room for me at any of my relative's houses). all my money goes to rent and other monthlys. i don't really have a supportive family, and the friends i thought i had in my city have left because "i'm too much of a downer." really supportive of them huh? now i just have really superficial relationships with the ones that were closest to me and i hate it...yeah, making stupid jokes is fun, but real friends should be there for each other, through anything. 

tonight i'm studying for finals and i would really enjoy some decent food. i've never asked for anything like this but maybe the universe will smile upon me today? i promise to pay it forward, i know that energy flows in a circle. i am really grateful for everything i do have and i know that i'm a million times better off than 98% of the world...but still...suffering is relative to the individual, isn't it? if you can help i will be eternally grateful to you and will do anything i can for you or for another person later on.

thanks for looking

[] pizza for vets in the hospital.. just an idea but i was wondering if anyone would be interested in ordering pizza's for the paralyzed veterans at the va in st louis? a lot of the patients are older gentleman with no family and some of them end up staying for months or even years. i saw this reddit and recently [posted a story](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/up8ap/then_why_the_hell_did_you_give_it_to_me/c4xdiq2) about my roommate in a different sub, saw this sub and made me thank of him.

i was there for 4 months late last year and remember the sunday dinners where the worst. if you are interested they eat dinner at 5pm cst, so if we ordered at 4pm it should arrive before they get dinner.

jefferson barracks sci unit, building 52 , st. louis, mo 63125 

(be sure to put a note to deliver to nurses station and say it's for the vets and nurses if you want, the nurses there are pretty awesome and have a thankless job)

if anyone needs the correct numbers to call, let me know. i just thought they would be pleasantly surprised by a bunch of awesome pizza. there are usually about 18 patients but they upgraded the facility so now there are about twice that. at dinner time there are about 6-8 staff (nurses mostly). anyways i'm going to order one for them also, i would do more but i'm broke and that's all i can afford :(

edit: several of the nurses there are redditors, forgot to mention that :)

so i've been unemployed for awhile now but doing what i need to to make things work and not trying to make it anyone else's problem, got some things going to try to help get me some kind of income going in the meantime. went to meet someone to sell an item and ended up turning back because they messaged that their car broke down. no big deal, stuff happens. went to heb to get some milk and bread, basic staple stuff. card declined. try again. declined again. insert sinking feeling here. try once more as credit. no dice. so i left empty handed. get home and check the bank account to see what has happened, because i had at least $20 to my name. nope. i'm now negative almost $200 due to a payment i wasn't aware was hitting today. fantastic.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

now, i have food, it's just not anything special (ramen, pasta, rice). that said, i would much rather people more needy than i get pizza'd. but if someone felt like helping a guy not feel like he's at the bottom of a dry well, i'd be quite thankful.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="tl;dr"&gt;

tried to buy basic foodstuffs, bank account surprise-buttsex, feels bad man.

&lt;/div&gt;
[] medium, one-topping pizza!. i'm not starving - i'm just hungry, and ramen's no longer cutting it (meat would be great, y'know?).  direct deposit goes through at midnight, but by then, everything is closed in the area (pizza hut, papa johns and donato's). anyone feel like helping a couple of people out?

[] girlfriend is struggling to get a teaching job and i'd love if someone could give her a networking contact....er a slice of pizza! [nj]. my girlfriend and i are both recent college graduates, and while my career is in very high demand (and i had no trouble finding a job), she's been struggling these last six months trying to make contacts and get her foot in the door. unfortunately, education is taking a pounding in this economy and she has her degree in k-12 art education, in new jersey. 

in the short amount of time my girlfriend doesn't spend subbing or working at her near minimum-wage job to barely make ends meet, she's cold-calling school districts and putting out resumes left and right. it would be one thing if she wasn't trying, but it pains me to see my girlfriend put in all this effort and have nothing pay off.

i would love to be able to surprise my girlfriend with some new teaching contacts, or some new leads or even some ideas of other jobs that could utilize her degree and background until a position comes up. 

i feel awkward writing this, but please, i am not looking for money. while i would appreciate the gesture there are more deserving posts here that could use monetary assistance. i just know how powerful and far the reach of reddit goes, and know that everyone loves to help a guy with a novelty throwaway account! thanks for any and all help.

thanks a bunch reddit
[] it's been a year since i could afford real pizza (portland, or). so i posted this on my facebook today:

"hi, i'd really love a pizza and a handful of sedatives. first chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool."

a friend responded with this link.
nothing special about my story, but here goes.
a bit over a year ago, i bombed out of college. hard. after that, i was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where i have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. throughout the year i have been bouncing around between cities, going back to eugene and corvallis for a time, and eventually went to texas because i wanted to meet a girl i'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. that journey was a complete disaster, and months after i wound up back in portland, i still think about it everyday. i still can't find a job... i interviewed at voodoo donuts the day before yesterday, and by now i would have heard back if i'd gotten the job. i feel like i kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. i'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year i've been watching a lot of the stuff i use to do my work break or disappear. my speakers broke, so i can't properly make music, i ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while i was trying to hitchhike to texas, as it was weighing me down. my laptop's hard drive fried out but i was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. i've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now i am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. i'm lucky in that i get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. but i can't remember the last time i had a good pizza. nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if i had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, i would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. however, since it was suggested to me, i figure i might as well give it a go.

what can i offer you? well, i can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. i live in the st. johns neighbourhood of north portland. hope i got everything i need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise. thanks reddit.
[] life sucks right now. my dead end job is killing me, i hate it, and i work way too hard at it. i got home tonight and wanted to quit, i get shit from customers on the nightly (i work in a restaurant) and i only make meh money. don't really have a whole lot else going for me at this point. could use some pizza... but if not, that's cool too, you guys have a great thing going here. 
[] pizza needed in england tonight thanks to small sick child. ugh, so woke up 2 days ago to my 9 year old puking with a fever turned out she ha a uti. much fun as last time she had one we ended up in hospital as she was hallucinating through the fever.
we've broken through the fever and shes on the mend again now so good to see her smile shes requesting all her favourite foods as shes obviously not eaten properly all weekend and i'd love to supply her with a pizza. 
[] going through a bit of an emotional doldrum. will photoshop for pizza!. i've been going through a bit of a rough summer, emotionally. i feel unmotivated and uninspired. to top it off, the other day my parents told me they don't think i'm ever going to make it in college... what a way to bring someone down. we had a huge fight and i'm currently at my boyfriend's house. i haven't had a delicious pizza made to my perfection in a long, long time and i'm desperately searching for something to lift my spirits.

*in return for a pizza, i will photoshop a panda bear with a machine gun wearing a beer hat, and holding a pizza, riding on a tyrannosaurus rex with a huge explosion in the background.*

thanks! 
[] college student poor, nearly out of food,

() dinner in pacific, mo?. hi everyone. i usually just lurk around reddit and read but i'm here today because i really need help. i usually do ok with bills and food but this month i had some unexpected bills and we are out of food. i posted in food pantry and assistance but someone told me maybe look here also. i was wondering if someone could help wit maybe a 15 dollar gift card so i can feed the kids tonight. i hate to come here and beg and i probably should have come earlier but i hate hate hate to ask for help. we have a dominos and they have those 5.99 pizzas if you order 3 and i have 4.oo so if someone could help i would be so thankful. i get paid on monday and i would happily send it back. thank you for reading.

[, indiana] overdrawn checking account, borrowing money from my parents, and rent is due on friday.. i'm using my real account, and it shames me that it's come to this.  
  
last friday i had to do something no one ever wants to do, i had to phone my mom and dad to ask for money. i have not lost my job, but my car's exhaust broke. for those familiar with cars, the clamp where the catalytic converter and exhaust meet up rusted through, and the rust had damaged the pipes and cat under the car. the shop's bill came to $320 and some change, to replace the rusted pipes/cat and weld up the connections.  
  
let me say that i'm not in a dire situation, my parents were able to lend me enough to cover my overdraft fee and most of my rent, but i've nothing left for food. i have enough frozen burritos to survive, but a warm pizza would be amazing.  
  
back to the escapism of videogames for the time being.

{} an awesome 8 year old deserves a pizza. (tx). howdy raop! i've been in a giant funk lately that i've been unable to pull myself out of, then then tonight my son surprised me. he wrote me a little note saying that i should play xbox with him and take my "mind off of things," along with other sweet things. 

we played for about 2 hours while he asked me questions about when i was in 3rd grade and joked around about space chimps. it was the funnest time i've had in a long time and really reminded me about what's important. 

i don't have access to my account until monday night since the fiance has my card on a trip for a class for work. i have stuff for the weekend but it's all meals that my son doesn't really enjoy that much. since neither of us will go hungry this weekend i will completely understand if you would rather give to someone who needs it more than myself, but i would love to treat my "punkin" for everything he did for me tomorrow sometime. taking a pizza to the park is one of his favorite things.

i will be making offers next week, whether or not i get a pizza so even if you're just reading this and you're hungry be sure to check back with me then. :) 

i think it's time for a great nights sleep now but i will check back tomorrow!

[] jacksonville, fl. i have nothing but condiments and maybe 3oz of lettuce until thursday. help?. this morning for breakfast, i consumed essentially what was left of my actual food. i had some cheese, bacon, a hamburger bun, and a salad. currently, i'm training for my new job and am finding it hard to focus without bringing lunch for my very full day. if i had a nice, hot, gooey pizza for dinner and lunch tomorrow, i'd be set. pizza hut has nice deals going on. buy me a pizza and i will trade you a body/hygiene/cosmetic product from my future store (you can message me if you want to know what store that is, but it is a really awesome one). thank you.
[] 19 and struggling, been off my feet for a few months.. hey my name is andrew. currently i'm unemployed and stream video games via twitch.tv full time to try and make some money here and there. i live in the denver, colorado area roughly.

i live at home with my mom after a few heavy life incidents led me to leave my job and move back home.

streaming hasn't been making me much lately and i've been pretty broke, had to quit smoking cold turkey and can't exactly afford food at the moment either.

the last few days i've been really achy and sick and my mom didn't get child support for whatever  reason so we are scraping by until we get food stamps in a few days.

i've been looking for a job and working on getting my ged to help out on that front but no luck so far seeing as how i can't commute downtown every day.

if anyone would be cool and get me a pizza or something, that would be pretty legit.

not really sure what else to put here, so sorry if anyone is looking for more info i'd be happy to edit my post for whatever reason.


edit: i saw a contest for some bad ms paint art, i like to draw champions from league of legends in paint for people who donate to my stream, so i'd be happy to draw one or more for someone who donates a pizza. (doesn't have to be league related, but i'm terrible.)

[] would love some stuffed crust pizza [baltimore]. haven't had stuffed crust pizza in ages and after paying rent, car insurance, and paying off my credit card i don't have tons of money available for such luxuries.  i have a verification code, so if you feel like being generous i can send that to you.  thanks!

[] edmonton alberta down in the dumps, and broke as a chump.. i in no way actually expect anyone to be kind enough to do this for me, but i thought i'd give it a shot.

i'll provide some back story just so that i don't come off as a mooch.
currently sitting at home alone for the weekend, family is over 3 hours away, and my girlfriend... (or whatever she is to me after the falling out we've had over the past 2 months) is headed out for the weekend to go camping with her bestfriend. we're working on our relationship and part of that involved me moving out on my own so i could focus on myself, find a job, and seek help for my severe depression, until i've made progress towards getting my shit together she's not willing to say we're in a relationship more serious than "seeing each other" sounds harsh, but really it's just because she wants me to prove that i'm actually going to get my shit together.

today is one of those days where i've slumped into a depressed state, not nearly as bad as some days, but i've made progress and will continue to strive for progress.
i guess my hope is that someone will be kind enough to make my day, so that when i've got my shit together i can do the same for someone that was once in my position.

anyways before i turn this into a book with my rambling...
tl;dr- broke, lonely, depressed, and really hungry (i've lost 15 lbs in the past 2 weeks... =( )

[] swindon, uk. doing a huge favour for a friend, was told i could help myself to what was in the fridge, but then i realised....... i'm currently dogsitting for a close friend. they were supposed to be home an hour ago, but i just got called and they have apologised and said they won't be back for about another 12 hours. they did say i could help myself to what was in the fridge, so i had a look and, and [this](http://imgur.com/vktku) was the sum total - 1 tub of butter, 1 tub of margerine, a tray of expired eggs, some wine, some flat pepsi, some stale milk and a bottle of lemonade. i'm so hungry right now it's unreal, and i will happily pay this forward when i get back home tonight.

[] finished my last final for the semester, roommate and i are snowed in tonight.. my roommate and i finished our finals today, of course we had one at the last timeslot (u of i has a terrible final schedule this year). we'd like to celebrate but it's starting to storm pretty bad out at the moment. a pizza would be delicious, this semester was a rough one. pretty please? :) i'll gladly pay it forward to a college kid who asks next time around.
[] broke-but-tryin' single mom. a pizza for me and my little guy would be such a treat! . i'm amazed that such a thing exists! i don't really know how this works, but if someone could get us a pizza we would be so grateful! we would eat the whole thing with much happy yelling while watching the iron giant. 
[]redditor since '09, sick, could use some good food to help get well! . this may i got pneumonia and ended up in the hospital for 4 days because my immune system wouldn't kick in and fight the infection in my lungs.  fast forward a few months and i am in the college of my dreams, but my immune system has taken a pot shot at me again.  first it was an ear infection in week 2 of fall quarter, now it is the flu.  i've missed so much class i may have to go on medical leave. 

my story is long and messy - my life really exploded this spring/summer, which is why i am a 30 year old living in the college dorms. *facepalm* i'd be glad to share more of the story if you'd like, but in the meantime it would be great to have some food other than the easy mac, stale tortilla chips and soda i've been living on since getting sick.  maybe something a little better would help me get well?  i can only hope!  thanks in advance, reddit :) 
[] broke and ...well. it's storming.. i live in tucson, az, and came out of work to find a small tree on the hood of my car after this afternoon's lovely storm. fixing this is going to be the rest of my money until payday on friday, and i'm just hoping that there's someone out there thinking about passing on a pizza. i'm a big believer in karma, and i'm hoping that she's going to be kind to me after the past few weeks of absolute shit. ugh. right before my vacation, too :(
[] pizza for friend in wilmington, de. hey reddit,

a really good friend of mine is currently running out of money waiting for the end of the semester at her college in wilmington, de. she's running low on food and money, and is feeling down since a lot of her friends have moved out for the semester. a pizza for her would be really, really awesome. thanks
() central ct resident in desperate need of a helping hand. hey reddit,

i've really hit some hard times recently, lost my job, kicked out of my apartment, car broke down. pretty much anything bad you could imagine going bad in one's life, it has happened to me.

all my family is in colorado, so moving out there is pretty much out of the questions. so right now i'm crashing on my buddies couch, but i'm not sure how long that will last or how long until he loses his mind and kicks me out.

i would love to be able to pay him back someway or another, and pizza popped into my mind. being as it is a friday night, and i don't have the fund to do much anything but breathe and drink free water, i'm not going out tonight. anyone have it in their heart to help out a fellow human being whose life has hit the skids?

[] adelaide australia. it's my fiance's birthday today and pizza would be an awesome way to convince her that reddit rocks.. i've been trying to convince her of the greatness of reddit and redditors for a while and i think free pizza on her birthday would convince her.
[] just would like something good to eat while i'm sick.. not like dying sick, just don't-feel-like-moving sick. soup &amp; noodles just isn't cutting it, but pizza isn't exactly in my budget right now.

i'd love to just have something tasty to eat on for a few days while i recover.

i live in pinebluff, nc &amp; the only place that delivers is pizza hut, so an egift for there would be amazing. thanks!

[] hungry medic would like pizza pie. hi there. im currently stuck on an army base and our defac (basically a cafeteria where they serve our meals) is closed. all defacs across post are closed. so, if you would like to order me a pizza, you can rest assured you will have the favor returned on the 1st of august when i get paid. also a little info on myself, combat medic, two years in service, live on ft stewart, ga, and im out of money because i spent it all on my sons birthday when i was on leave last week. alright thats it, lets hope this works.

[] hungry girl in the uk. first off, i will admit i am new, and i made my account after discovering this subreddit.  but i have been a lurker for quite a while and have even gotten my mum addicted to this site (and the aww sub).  
right now i have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  but i also have no food, or cash.  i'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.  i don't think it's fair to people, especially if they think i'm only after pity.  but i will explain some, at least that's connected to why i'm in this situation.  otherwise, what's the point?  
my baby sister died when she was barely out of her teens.  i was still a teen myself at the time, and my mum took it very badly.  i ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, i kind of snapped (or broke. however you want to put it).  it's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.  
i do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  i have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.  
i'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  even though sometimes i really should.  that's just the way i was raised.  sucky, yes, but at least i have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.  

i don't know what kind of proof you could ask for about me.  but please feel free to ask away and i will try my best to verify anything.  unless you want a picture of me.  that's just wrong.  and evil.  and....wrong :)

[] home-made dinner fell on the floor. pizza feels like the only thing that will fill the frustration void.. first time pizza poster- [nyc area] so i spent a good hour cutting  fresh chicken breasts, brushing egg yolk on them, some flour, a lot of bread crumbs and deep frying them to deliciousness. tried to eat them with my girlfriend while studying for biology in our tiny apartment and boom- plate falls on the floor. oh, and i also lost my playstation 3 to a bunch of frat boys who threw a party with my roomate who by accident spilled an entire cup of alcohol into the top vent. shitty, shitty 48 hours its been. =/ needless to say- low on cash and virtually no food in the fridge. heres a picture of one of the plates   http://imgur.com/wlskh 

oh and also, i want to state that my girlfriend does not believe at all this sub reddit exists and that random people actually send pizza to strangers -randomly. 

tl;dr- shitty 48 hours, home made chicken fingers fell on the floor. starving. tummy feels sad.

[] my roommate &amp; best friend of 10+ years started a pizza fast for november. i consider this an act of treason against our friendship! reddit, help me win her back to the dark side with a pizza! (chicago). november is notorious for "no-shave" or "no-whatever" 30 day fasting, but this is crossing the line! we have bonded over so many things via pizza, it is one of the major cornerstones of our friendship. i have already fought several long battles with her over this- how dare she leave me in the trenches alone! she will be home from work in about an hour and a half to two hours. this is my final stand against no-pizza-november, she won't listen to my reasoning any longer - reddit help me out and be the calvary!

[] finland, hungry, broke and snowing like crazy outside. . hey all, 
it's been nice reading some of the stories on here, didn't think i would ever contribute one of my own but here goes.
basically long story short i lost my wallet last weekend and had to cancel all my cards, 
i'm an international student here a couple of thousand miles from home while not entirely on my own i've been making do with the 20euros i had in my pocket since friday.
i was hoping i might get a new card today it never came and now i'm looking at recycling some empty bottles so i can buy some bread for the evening.
if someone fancied the challenge of ordering pizza on a finnish website i would be forever grateful as i really don't want to go asking friends for some spare dinner on valentines day.

[] after 4 months of unemployment, things are looking up. hi all, thanks for taking the time to even look at a request on here.

so the story is i've been unemployed since i got out of the air force and doing pretty okay without unemployment benefits. but i've started my new job and its a 20 mile drive both ways and not exactly conducive to my 50 dollar a week income from selling plasma. to top it off, today i was moved to a 8-5 shift and couldn't make it in time to donate due to traffic.

i won't get paid until next friday, which will be kind of a stretch. not looking for anything major, just hoping for a nice random act to keep me full until tomorrow afternoon.

and i guess to guilt you guys a bit, my new job is providing network support to literally every army hospital in the world and keeping their gears turning. to say the least, it is stressful.

but that's that, thought i might try one of these. thanks for reading :d
[]help a bad luck loser in bloomington, il feel better!. so yeah... employer just told me to be packed up and out of here in two weeks this past friday.  i'm backed up on my finances because of kidney stones that were so painful that i couldn't work a full 40 for a few weeks.  my job has no benefits and i couldn't afford to go to the doctor, so i manned up and gritted my teeth through it without awesome drugs...  
  
now my power, internet(which i'm downgrading soon) and tv service(i'm cutting the cord as soon as this stupid contract is gone), cell phone bills(on contract so nothing i can do here) are all late.  i've been late on my car payment twice in the past 5 months.  i can't afford to pay any of them right now because my rent is coming due, and if i don't pay that on time they charge a $50 late fee plus $10 for every additional day late.  i also need gas, and my car insurance is going to be due in full soon.  and i have a huge student loan in my mother's name with myself co-signed that i haven't been able to make the payment on for a few months... so i'm just hurting her.
  
i live alone and haven't really made many friends since i moved to this state.  i've been begging for part time jobs for over a year and no one is hiring me.  now i'm close to being unemployed and my employer(staffing firm) hasn't found me a replacement yet.  
  
i'm subsisting on ramen, buttered pasta, the cheapest hot dogs i can find, and any other sale items i can find for less than $1 per dinner, around .50-.75 for lunch, and i don't even eat breakfast.  
  
before the troubles started i loved that new dominos pan pizza.  i'm a cynical, pissed off, "hates everything" manic depressive who doesn't like to smile.  but that stuff always puts a smile on my face.  
  
  
i'm going to join this sub, and as soon as i can i will return the gesture if someone can help me feel good again for a little bit before i start looking for stuff in my apartment to sell to pay these stupid bills.  
  
if you live in the area i would be happy to try to help you with any technology issues that you may be having in return.

**update**: speakercity was kind enough to help a brother out! my pizza is already on the way. thank you for offering, lakerz4life and irritableowlsyndrome, too.
[] hungry and broke. me, my girlfriend and our 4 month old son just moved into our house a few weeks ago. with moving expenses and bill deposits we are so broke that we can't buy food for this week. i'm not a big guy, 6'1 170lbs, but i eat like a horse and this week i have only ate one pbj sandwich a day and my girlfriend has only had one thing of noodles per day if that. my son stays well fed, we make sure of that. so i'm only asking for a pizza today, so that maybe we can fill our stomachs for the next few days. in a few weeks when our situation gets better, i will pass on the kindness.

[]desperately wanting something to eat in ohio. . hey reddit, i'm a 20 year old female, i'm currently starving or at least it feels that way. i haven't ate anything since yesterday morning. i tried to go to the pantry today but they aren't open until tomorrow and tomorrow i wont need help because i get my check. i work a full-time job and currently drained my savings for a car so i didn't have to ride the metro back and forth to work. 
i've been on reddit for over a year and helped a lot of people out in r/assistance, if someone could help me out it would mean a lot, i'm currently extremely dizzy and i think it's due to the lack of food.
please pm for proof and my real account name, i'd be glad to pay it back or pay it forward. 

[] been depressed, a pizza would be nice.. there's a bunch of people around here who actually need a pizza 'cause they don't have food or whatever. so if you're looking to give, get to them first.


i've been depressed for quite a while now, give or take 4 years, mainly due to the pressure from my family to go to college and get a degree. i've messed up quite a bit during that time, all of it my fault honestly, and so i've gotten academically suspended for a year. this has escalated my depression because i feel like i'm just throwing away opportunities like it's nothing and letting everyone i know down. today's been especially bad, i had a pretty shitty dream were everyone finds out what i failure i am, the first thought i had today was about suicide. i know i wont do anything, but it's still an awful way to start my day. so i've been drinking the day away and being generally useless. 

sorry for the boring story but it just feels better to type it out. it's not like i'm lacking food, i could go make a sandwich, but a pizza would be nice since i don't have the money for that.     
[] uk, £6.70 in my account, paid in 3 days but fed up of pasta with pesto. as the title says, simply a bit more broke than normal this month. i get paid on the 28th and i have enough pasta + pesto to last (and cereal for breakfast) but i'm just sick of it having basically eaten that for over a week now.

    tech support stuff

basically, computer-related stuff. :-)

[] help a girl out, it's been a hard couple of months.. i feel a little weird asking this as i don't really need a pizza but it's been a tough few months and the idea of cooking anything is just more than i can handle at the moment. i recently switched jobs and haven't had a day off since the end of september, had my boss basically tell me to fuck off regarding my scheduling and had a panic attack in the middle of my shift in front of customers. i'd love a pizza but simply cannot afford to order one. anyone in the portland, or area want to help me out? i'll eat everything except for olives and pineapple.

[] se idaho - wanna surprise my father. so, here is my story. i am a 19 year old college student that has been trying to get various jobs for 5 years now. my town is at a low point for a while and even getting hired at mcdonalds is a competition between young kids and elders. this, however, is beside the point.

i want to surprise my dad with his favorite large cheese pizza from pizza hut. i want to do this because he recently quit smoking. this is pretty big as my family as a huge history of addiction. he quit drinking 2 years ago after 3 years of nearly killing himself. he has liver cirrhosis and if he cannot get a transplant within 6 years, he is guaranteed to die. so, i want to reward him for cleaning himself up and being strong for the rest of our family. if someone can help, that would be great. i have seen some awesome things done here, and you are all fantastic.

thank you

[]doing it rough. paying off debt from failed attempt at my own business. job pays monthly.  no cash until i am paid in 3 days. would love a pizza tonight. (australia). hi raop

as the title suggests, i have been doing it tough over the last few months.  i am knee deep in debt from being screwed by my partner while trying to start a business.  my current job pays monthly and i am a few days out from being paid but due to some unforeseen vet bills this month, i have found myself without much money or food for the last 2 weeks.  
tonight, i will be having another meal of rice and peas, which i have been surviving on since my cats incident (she is fine now, thankfully) and i am dieing for something nice for a sunday night.  if there is a kind internet stranger out there who feels like helping someone who has been going through a rough time over the last few months, it would make my entire year!  when i get paid i'll be happy to come visit again to pass the karma on to someone else who needs it. 
i live in australia, if that makes a difference.

[] ontario, canada. lost my job, stuck home sick, hungry.. hi randomactsofpizza, 

so, i'm having a terrible weekend. i got given a weeks notice at my "job" last week, and other places i've been talking to aren't calling me back. i'm going to run out of money soon, and now i've spent the last three days at home sick, and i am not even going to get my last couple days pay if i can't get well enough to go to work. i had my phone stolen a month ago, and my computer has nearly completely stopped working(and the warranty service has been ignoring me for two months), i'm not sure if i can post this without it freezing again. 
raop, i'm tired, and hungry, and sick, and so discouraged. would any kind soul be able to help me out?

thanks so much.
[] hartford, ct - single guy, just been dumped and fired in a weeks period.  need to catch a break. so, yeah, as the title reads, i've had one hell of a week.  i had a job as a clerical assistant in the east hartford area for about 2 months, essentially doing scrub work, and thought everything was going well, until out of the blue on tuesday, they fired me without a real reason.  i've since been on a few job interviews, but this economy is killing everything up here, and i'm getting scared.

as a cherry on top of my already wonderful week, my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years left me, saying we've been moving in separate directions for some time now.  i think this is code for she's been fucking everyone in town behind my back, but who knows.

so reddit, i come to you on my knees, looking for a little help.  i know how sad and pathetic it sounds, but a pizza would help erase the memory of this week, but i just don't have the means to go out and buy one now, since i'm unemployed, paying both sides of my rent, utilities and misc. expenses. 
[]columbia, sc. two chicken breasts and $0.96 til friday.. it's been a very tight two weeks, and the wife and i are approaching friday with a very empty wallet.  we have enough gas in the car to get to and from work, but not enough fuel for our bellies.  we're rocking a solid two chicken breasts in the freezer - adequate for one night's dinner.  we're sitting pretty on a whopping ninety-six cent til friday morning, and getting desperate as to what we're doing for dinner wednesday or thursday.

and then i heard about raop.  i promise to whomever helps my wife and i in our time of need that we will pass the good fortune on come friday.

thank you for reading this, and thank you for browsing this amazing subreddit.

[] california: my dad passed away two weeks ago and i've been helping out my mom a lot. more broke than usual and will come back to get someone else a pizza when things are better next month.. my dad passed away on july 11th and i've been supporting my mom since her income was based on him. she was his caregiver. i've managed all of her financial issues lately, because she has a hard time asking others for help, so i've done everything from collecting donations on gofundme for the cremation costs and asking family and friends for money for her living costs for her. it has been exhausting. plus she lives a few hours away so i've been shelling out so much in gas.

meanwhile i started a new job and training hours were slim this past couple weeks. i also go to school; just an online class this summer, but normally full time. i'm not usually so broke, but this past month or so has been really rough. my wife and i would adore a pizza during this time! i would also be happy to come back and fund a pizza for someone else. 

thanks for reading!

[] ny- pizza for a family in need. id really like to have a nice pizza dinner with my family. its been a long time. we had our house destroyed by the hurricane irene. its still standing but not livable and were told we have to rebuild it. me, my husband and our four kids are staying with my sister. its really hard cuz we were struggling before (i was laid off a few mo ago) and now its just scary sometimes. im going to career centers and applying for jobs, but there just arent any. my husband takes ot when its available. our church is helping us but there are others who need much more and i dont want to take away from them.

we have food on the table. its usually not much more than boiled chicken and instant potatos but were managing. a pizza dinner would be an incredible treat. even my teen and pre-teen would sit down with us if there was pizza! if anyone can help, id be so happy.

thank you
[] birthday tommorrow, work could be better. i turn 20 tommorrow and i don't think i'll work this week because i have to code documents (think identifying docs using a program). well we don't have enough documents to do (damn you digital media!) so our boss tells my and my coworkers to go home and come back when we get a call. last time that happened, they called us a week later, so we didn't work a whole week. 

anyways, i love pizza. it's my favorite food. and i live in houston. 

thanks! 

edit: i'll give back when i have the money to spend on pizza. 
[] i would like to send some pizzas to the moderators of /r/nfl. i can't say that i've seen this before, but the moderators of /r/nfl have done a fantastic job for a long time.  they've kept the peace, created a subreddit that has gotten nothing but compliments on how it looks (one of the reddit admins swung by to give compliments) and have given an incredible amount of time and energy into the community and updating it.

i'm not sure if their are any regulars over there, but if there are i'm sure you know what a great job these guys have done.  i think offering these guys a pizza would be a great way to show thanks.

http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/about/moderators

there is a list of moderators.  i know off the top of my head that /u/napoleonbonerparts has had a huge role in making the sub looking the way it does, but there are many others that have done a fantastic job.

/r/random_acts_of_pizza i ask of you fine people to offer these moderators a pizza.  if you're not sure who to send one to, just ask or send a message, i'm sure they'll gladly direct you to a deserving moderator.

thanks for your time, and if this is unorthodox, well, it is random, isn't it?

[] looking for something good to eat.. the girlfriend and i were sitting at home and after repeatedly checking the cabinets she decided she'd rather be hungry than eat any more ramen. personally i could eat the stuff every day for another couple of months, but she's a little more high maintenance than i am. we're in between checks and had a ticket (10 over) recently that got rid of nearly all my disposable income.
she'd deeply appreciate the gooey cheesy deliciousness and i really wouldn't mind myself!

[] poconos (pa) single dad. my brother told me about this site a while ago. after looking at other entries, i'm blown away. i hope someone can extend their random acts of pizza kindness to my family and me.
i don't want to make anyone sad, but the side says to be honest. my wife was killed in a car accident a year ago last week. she was an amazing mother and wife. readjusting has been really hard, but our kids are tough and are working through it. i have an amazing support system, but sometimes things just don't add up. my parents and her dad are incredible and do so much for us, but i hate asking them for help. they already do so much and it's really embarrassing not being able to give my kids something as small as pizza. normally we do a "pizza" night once a month, but with school just starting, i'm coming up short. i hate asking for help, but it seems like a really open and friendly environment, so i'd like to try. i can't wait to pay it back next month. i'm thinking the kids can pick a contest and the winner. thanking you from the bottom of my heart. jim
[] out of food, out of money (for now). 19-year old college student here, i have a grand total of 4 dollars in my bank account at the moment, and just ran out of all my food. can somebody help me out here? i'm getting paid this week sometime and will definitely return the favor. thanks in advance if anybody can save me here.
[] tennessee closing at work... again. thought i'd ask for a pizza to make me feel better. i've been closing up at work for going on two weeks now, getting paid minimum wage and putting almost every cent toward rent next month. coming home to a bowl of ramen and sleeping until time to do it all again is starting to wear on me. anyone out there the kind of person who wants to give a random internet stranger[me] a pizza for troubles that, i'm sure, sound less troubling on a screen?
[] i have been craving pizza for two weeks now and it was my birthday 4 days ago.. hi, i am a married college student with no job or income, my wife doesn't have one either. right now we have about 40 bucks to spend for the rest of the month until we get our school financial aid in the last week of august.

as i mentioned before it was my birthday a few days ago and no one bought me pizza :( sad day. on top of that i just went to go get the cheesecake my wife made for me for my birthday and someone ate it before i could. we are living with her parents at the moment because it is close to the school we both attend, but we recently moved here and haven't been able to find jobs yet, the only money we have been living on is the left over financial aid from last spring semester.

we can make it the rest of the month food wise, but not pizza wise. without pizza how will we survive?

edit: location is around sacramento california. 

also our favorite type of pizza is a deal from papa johns we regularly get when we have money that costs around 15-20 bucks. i can't remember the exact price.

[] cardiff, wales,uk, girlfriend just left me after 4 years, not getting paid till friday, pizza would really help me out right now!. so this is what happened (long story short)! my girlfriend rang me yesterday and said we needed to sort things out, went to meet her and she blurted out how she hasn't been happy for a while and that i'm not the same guy i used to be - dunno how i'm gonna get through this one, i loved her to bits.

to top it all off i don't get paid till friday and even then it will be a tiny amount, i don't do many shifts because i suffer from depression, all money goes on living and its never enough - some pizza would really perk me up right now in this dark times.

{} home &amp; half pay - penniless on the hard . hello, pizza gods? are you there? it's me, omnomdeplum. 
i am but a humble tall ship sailor, which as you well know, in this day in age means i've taken vows of voluntary poverty. teaching children how to sail an 18th century ship is well and good - however there's a point where one realizes that it's not paying the bills. 

so, having recently returned from life on the high seas, i find myself working my arse off to pay the sudden onslaught of bills that i've returned to, which leaves little for food stuffs. i've applied for work at the seattle art museum (they have some awesome exhibitions coming in), but should i get this job, i won't see positive pay off well into next month. 

thus, pizza gods.. here i am, a sailor with a roof, but no nom'ibles. please, if it is within your power to do so, send me a sign - an omen of good will that will get me through the night, and hopefully tomorrow - i'll find out if i get that job tomorrow or not.

in the name of the godfather, the caesar &amp; the long lost, but not forgotten domino mascot, i pray.

: time to come clean, i'm running on fumes. hey all,

my life is in the gutter right now.  i've been trying to find a job while trying to take night classes, but neither are working out very well at this point.

i've got a little bit of my reserves left, but that has to last me for the unforeseeable future, and i don't know when or where my next job will come from.

i know it may sound a little sad, but i've forgotten what pizza tastes like, it's been so long since i've had any.  and being transplanted from chicago, this is not a good feeling.

anyone have it within themselves to help me out?
[] just a kid with an empty stomach in dallas texas. it always hurts me to ask others for help. 
i'm at my fathers apartment right now. today is his first day at a new job, thank the lord! well, he left today and i don't know what time he will come home. his job is to help people move, so i doubt he'll be home anytime soon. he found this job after months of unemployment, so there's not much in our fridge other than cold franks. a hot pizza would really hit the spot for me right about now. i made this throw-away account because i have friends who frequent reddit, and i would not want them to see me in despair. thank you in advance, reddit.

tl;dr
dad left for new job. at apartment alone. nothing in fridge. 
[] pizza in the baltimore area sunday or monday please- help me say thank you to a friend.. hey there- i have a special request. sunday afternoon i am driving from nh to baltimore to see a lupus/antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) specialist at john's hopkins as aps is pretty rare and i have been pretty sick recently and getting worse, not better. 

a friend i actually met through a couch surfer i hosted has become like a surrogate dad to me and is flying here from california to drive me down- he is an incredible person and i owe him my life. he does so much for me and has agreed to drop everything to make sure i get the care i need to get well. 

anyhow, he is paying for everything for this trip- including the visit if i can't get any financial aid help (have submitted an application) as i don't have insurance. i can't tell you how blessed i am to have this man in my life. 

other than gratitude i have nothing to offer him as i am very broke due to my illness keeping me from working despite trying desperately to get well enough to resume my career. 

can anyone arrange to have a pizza delivered to where we are staying either sunday night when we are due to arrive or monday for after my appointment? i think he would appreciate it and i know i would more than words could say!

i am still not sure where we are staying yet or exactly when we are arriving but i can let the giver know the exact details as soon as i know. i am hoping to stay sunday with a friend from high school in nearby elkhorn but if not it will be a hotel close to jhmc. subsequent days will definitely be in a hotel (i will be outpatient, not in patient). 

many thanks for even reading and considering this!

[] i forgot my wallet at home [washington, d.c.]. hi, reddit:

i have no idea if my reason is considered a proper reason for asking for a pizza, so forgive me if this seems like a lame request, haha.  

i forgot my wallet at home this morning and went to work.  now i'm in the office and i don't have lunch.  would really like a small pizza or just a slice to tide me over until i can go home tonight.  


() just laid off, car broke down, would love a pizza. hey guys,

my story is no where as bad as everyone else's on here, but i would love to catch a break from someone if they are willing and able.

i was laid off last week from my job of 5 years, they are downsizing, which i guess means my boss is taking a bigger paycheck this year and i was expendable.

for the cherry on top, my old '93 honda civic broke down on me, it's sitting in the shop, and i don't want to pay for that pos to be fixed, but i have no other offers.

i'm a single guy, no girlfriend or wife or children that i know of, so i don't have a lot of mouths to feed, but i would love to at least stuff my face with something greasy and warm tonight and wallow in my sorrows.

thanks reddit, you guys are all awesome.

: los angeles! starting my business, would love a pizza. let's make a deal.. starting a personalized songwriting business. it's going to turn into a community for songwriters and listeners to interact and coordinate the creation of a personalized song. ideally, it's going to forever close the gap between the songwriter and listener, and give struggling, talented songwriters an opportunity to bring happiness to anyone in need of a song, for anything; but i've got a lot of work to do before then.

i probably won't have enough for rent this month, but my landlord's anniversary is coming up and i'm writing a song for his wife, in exchange for letting me be a week late. this leaves the unfortunate angle of food. i'm all out of bread.

instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. i will write a song about whatever you want. (literally.) it will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. i'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.

if you're interested in hearing about my business, i'm funding step 1 through kickstarter.com. [here's the link to that](http://kck.st/pgkaih) back me, or send it to a friend you think might be interested in a personalized song. 

otherwise, pizza for a song. savvy?

if you want to hear some samples of what i do, check www.soundcloud.com/thallett (not sure why it's not linking...) out.

thanks!

[] a pizza for a good friend.. one of my good friends has recently been kicked out of his dad's house. he's 19, and has no where to go. i guess he's been staying in the parking lot of the store by my house, and he finally just mustered up the courage to ask for a warm bed for a few nights. my mom and i have such a bed, but we have very little funds. we've been living off free bagels and bananas for a while now. i can keep going off of that but i know my friend could really use something more special. i don't think he's actually eaten for a couple days. anyways, i'm in boise idaho, and he'll be staying the night tonight. he's already really appreciative of the bed, but doesn't know i'm trying to do this. i'm working right now, but when i get my paycheck i'll be sure to pay it forward. if anyone can help out, it would mean the world to me, and him. thanks for being an awesome subreddit.

{ing} not for me, for a friend in georgia. i can't believe i never found reddit before today, i've been wasting my life on 4chan -_- things are a lot more awesome here.

so i heard you can request pizza here, well i just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so i'm good. i wanna repay a favor to a friend i've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.

i lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. he's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when i wouldn't have been able to otherwise. he lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so i don't have to waste money on a cab! i've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.

he's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. i had to notarize my i-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. he spent 5 hours on tuesday not only taking me to the dmv and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. i tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. the mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure i could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.

he's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. i won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. i wanna thank him but i had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so i'm  fresh out of dough. it never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until i wandered on here. he can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what i wanna do.

anyone think they can spot me a gift card so i can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? he's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew i needed the money. this would be a small drop in the bucket but i wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. i don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, i'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, i know he could. so pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?

i don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. i can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how i wanna start.
[] pizza for two, northwest chicago, il. hey there reddit. things haven't been going right for the next few days. my [roommate and best friend](http://imgur.com/aljup) started having suicidal thoughts a few days ago, and ended up checking herself into the er for observation. i've just paid off rent, two weeks late, and have no money until thursday. and my younger sister came over today because she keeps getting sick at her apartment, which means there's two mouths to feed and not much food to go around.

i'm lonely, sad, and worn down and i'm hoping that some pizza and silly tv shows might turn that around. thing is, there's no pizza currently. if anyone is willing to donate some i would be insanely grateful. 

thanks in advance.
[] starving student, financial aid has been delayed and my familys broke until oct. pizza would be incredible. (cali). my first time posting here so i thought i'd try it out. i've been broke from putting money into my gas tank for the 40 minute drive to school. on top of that my financial aid got delayed and my girlfriend (and we're no longer together) left for school this week. broke and alone :(

[] it's been a trying week for me and my nerd herd (3 kids) and pizza would really cheer us up.  - rochester, ny. ok, so i feel super weird doing this, but our week could really use a bright spot. i'm a single dad of three of the greatest junior geeks you could ask for. after a week filled with bad news, we decided tonight we're all just going to huddle up together in the living room and watch back to the future and i would love to surprise them with pizza. 

i'm willing to offer up any verification you would like, and of course verify with a thank you post and pm to the mods.

we're not going to starve without the pizza, so if you see someone nerdier, please help them first. but if you can spare, it would bring some major smiles to my home. thanks for reading this!

edit: blerg...that should have said needier above, not nerdier. i'm not sure you will find nerdier people. :-)


[req] first fathers day with out a father.  just need a little light.. edit: disregard, girl invited me to bbq.  see you in a month, i'll still send out the pizzas.

all alone on fathers day sucks more than i thought it would.  i don't need much, just a small cheese from someone who cares to cheer me up.  i don't have enough $ for pizza and the gas i'll need to work my shitty job.  

i've never done this before but if i get something i'll send out two pizzas next month in your honor.
[] would like to eat tonight, but if it's too late, tomorrow would be nice.. first things first, this is a sock puppet account.

second things second, i do have a reputable **real** account and i will talk to you on that account if you private message me first on this one. i'm the creator/mod of a top 50 most active subreddit (according to [subredditfinder](http://subredditfinder.com/)). it's also in the top 100 in most subscribed, fastest rising, and other categories. the reason why i even mention this is so you know i'm a real redditor and not some random outsider trying to exploit your generosity. i'm not using my real account name for reasons i will thoroughly explain if you im me. even if you don't plan on helping me.

finally, what i **can** explain here in the open is this: i've lost 15lbs in ~1 week due to not eating. i've lost my appetite because of a major life crisis, but now as i'm trying to get back into the swing of things i need to be strong but severe loss of financial stability (i think the technical term is being broke as fuck) means that i'm starting to break down physically, and that will jeopardize my ability to get back on track with my life.

i would actually prefer groceries (maybe milk, bread, or eggs), but i know thre is no random_acts_of_balanced_nutrition out there. i don't even know if i can get food stamps by now, and even if i can it might be too late. either way, i would appreciate pizza just as much.

anyways, i realize that i am rambling, but i'd be more than glad to explain my full situation to anyone that cares. i just don't want to make this post searchable by a particular person for reasons i will explain.

if this sounds shady, i completely understand. but again, i will be more than glad to give full details in pm; info which can easily be verified.

just don't contact me with a sockpuppet account. i don't want some troll to go and fuck me over with the sensitive info i give them. we can talk 1-on-1 with our legit accounts.
 i don't get paid till tomorrow, but i'm hungry today!. i would really appreciate a free pizza, i don't know if it works this specifically, but pizza hut is the closest to my house. if not that, then papa johns. please and thank you ahead of time, keesha

my two daughters and son are my rock and my world, why i get out of bed in the morning to work a job where i'm underpaid and busting my back day in and day out.  i would love to be able to surprise them with a nice little pizza treat at some point, try to boost their spirits during this rough patch in our lives.

i would love to be on here with a different story, one in which i'm able to give out pizza to those struggling within the community, and hopefully, who knows, i might be able to at some point.  all i know is that i will pay it forward in any way possible when i can.
[] studying for a class and test for the new job i am starting soon and i am hungry. i'm working part time now, my hours were recently cut, and i can't even afford to pay my current bills. i am about to get a new job in insurance sales, which will cure my financial woes (and will be able to pay it forward). however, i have a class and an exam to take and then i have to apply for a license, and it's still gonna be several weeks. in the meantime, i'm super hungry. and pizza just sounds so damn good. i'm in virginia, if that matters.
ing some help for dinner for a single mother of 2 recently laid off. . i am a single mother of 2 who recently lost my job. we are on such a tight budget &amp; unable to afford to eat anything other than hot dogs ramen n mac n cheese. waiting on assitance &amp; employers seems to take forever when u r so desperate &amp; have to provide for 2. my sons would love some pizza since this is unaffordable for us. thank you so much for your kindness. happy 4th!

[] kentucky, usa. starving. mom recently beat cancer's ass and is having a tough time keeping a job.. as the title says, i'm currently 17, and living with my mom that recently kicked cancer's ass (i am completely unsure what type of cancer it was/is) but she's having a tough time keeping a job and we barely have any food to eat. i don't really know of a way to prove this for some of the people that may or may not believe me.

just hoping someone would be kind enough to send a pizza our way, this was kind of a last resort, to "ask" or "beg" for food.

anyways, thanks for taking the time into reading this.
[] lakewood, co 80232. i only have $4 until friday. i will happily buy someone some pizza on friday if i could get a little help today. . i had my hours cut at work from 40 to 24 a week. for this reason i am very broke right now, and going to move back in with my father in two weeks. i only have $4, and being gluten free i don't have many options with that much money (no options really). if someone could send a gluten free pizza my way, i would be very thankful, and purchase one for somebody on friday when i get paid. if you are wondering how to get a gluten free pizza, dominos does a great job with it. not sure if pizza hut or anyone else does gluten free, but i trust dominos. please let me know if you are able to help me out today, i could really use some food! thanks in advance!
[] would greatly appreciate a pizza in tempe, az. recently had lots of unexpected school related expenses come up, leaving me with 3 bucks in my account. would love a pizza to break up the monotony of ramen/walmart canned lasagna/rice. i can provide proof, and will pay it forward as soon as i can (probably the check after this next one). thanks.
[  ] papa john's gift card. so... i guess i put my little sob story here.  well, i'm poor, lonely, and hungry, and longing for some pizza to fill the emptiness in my soul.
[] 20 y/o, us. just heard about sub...taking care of elementary school age siblings. friday night treat for us?. hey guys so i just heard about this subreddit, it's crazy how great of a community this is. so i've been watching over my younger sister and 2 brothers (10, 8 &amp; 7 respectively). for the past 6 weeks now, we've been staying at my mother's house while she's away. i love em im a lot older so i took care of all three since they were babies i'm almost like an uncle haha. i've been paying all the bills except the rent. i work part time as a janitor while they're at school but have to be at the bus stop when they get off every day. on food stamps so we get by but we're running low and they honestly don't get a treat like this often. so yeah i don't want to post a whole story of my life but if there's anyone out there who's willing it would be truly appreciated! im not asking for much, just a large pizza or maybe 2 mediums? any questions, just ask! thanks.
[] location: 39°42′34″n 90°13′47″w. i have been going on a downward cycle lately. i've recently lost my mother to cancer. without me knowing about the loan my mother had taken out a few years ago, my family ended up losing our store. my grandparents put everything they had into that store and it makes me sick to know that it's gone. depression has kept me away from many things and this includes the day to day business and just knowing how far in the red we were.

i have tried very hard to be a contributing member of society, but after 6 months of no work i am quickly losing hope. the one thing i have wanted for so long involves a tall glass of soda and a thick slice of pepperoni pizza. no matter how i dress up these minute noodles, the taste cannot compare to a delicious slice of pizza. i'm hoping some kind soul out there would be nice enough to treat me to some pizza please. i don't know exactly how this works, but i've been reading and i'm intrigued. some pizza could definitely cheer me up. thank you.
[] hungry girl craving pizza.. couple days before pay day and totally broke and in want of pizza.  nothing pressing, but i thought what the hell. ^__^

[] phoenix, arizona - would like to finally have my first pizza since finding out i have celiac disease tonight while watching the new season of whose line is it anyway?. so this isn't a sob story, i just want to finally have a gluten free pizza tonight for the return of whose line! i'm pretty sure domino's is the only chain that has gluten free pizza, but if anyone else knows a place that has some i would be grateful to know about it! (i hope it's at least close to being as good as a regular pizza....oh god i miss it so much)
[] kansas city, mo. totally craving a stuffed crust, not expecting at all, just would be nice since i am currently unemployed
[] gf had worst day ever, several weeks without paycheck. background: health insurance got cancelled because left old job, new job didn't start for a while, started in that magical time frame that allowed me to go way too long without a paycheck and cobra wants 900 dollars so she can get her shots to continue to finish her education. 

so, i'd really love for her to fill up on a yummy pizza.  if this works, i love the internet. if it doesn't, i still love the internet!

we're just north of philadelphia, pa 

[] my interactive multimedia project for your pizza. for quite a while now, i have been nonstop hard at work on an interactive multimedia project called [[6x]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmcqep2v_wo) - a double-disc immersive experience with hours of puzzles, "flash films", trip-tools, hallucinogenic visuals, and tons of hidden features.  caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this dvd package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-dvd set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.

*note: contains disturbing and/or adult material. intended for mature audiences only.*


the project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on august 20th, 2013.  previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.

**so here's the thing:**
i'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but i do have the dvd package to offer in exchange.  the only hitch is - it won't be released until august 20th.  so if any redditors are interested in the dvd or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!

**edit: feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, i understand it's kind of hard to describe.**

[] pimp in distress... (houston, tx area). pimpin aint easy! 

to expand on this, i'm feeling a little down. some pizza might be able to cheer me up. unfortunately, my financial situation (broke, college, etc.) wont allow it. i feel a little awkward just begging on here, and im sure this wont work, but i figured why not. =/ anyway, if for some reason you do feel like helping me out i would be really grateful. 
[]first time on my own. i just recently moved to a new town (first time on my own). i have tried very hard to get a job doing anything. i am a very hard worker but, no one seems to care about that anymore. i will probably have to move back home because my parents won't help me with anything. im 19 and going to school for film and photography. i have heard reddit was a very friendly community. i have posted stuff before but am still kinda new to this. any help will be greatly appreciated and i will somehow try to pay it forward. thank you all.

[r] for a completely broke college student, extremely desperate please help.. so here's my story, i just applied to transfer for other schools because i can't afford my current one so i just dropped 270+ dollars on applications, i am also currently taking an emt course that up until now i thought was completely paid for and just found out i have to pay for the simulation test, on top of the national registry test and also get my ambulatory license before i can even apply for a job. this all adds up to another 300+ dollars and i just had to pay rent which was another 450+ dollars. i have no food in my apartment except for 6 bags of popcorn and a gallon of water, and i have 20 dollars left in the banks. i don't have an official job but work in landscaping making money on the side whenever they have room for one more worker. my parents help but they can't help much and i don't want to worry them with this. a pizza would help me a lot, that would at least secure me for 3 more days just to keep the hunger away, especially during my finals week where concentration is a necessity. so please help, i have requested before when someone posts an offer but right now i am really really desperate so please help.

[] usa, cal. tomorrow is my 6 month monthaversary! august 3, 13. first time requester here. i know it's pretty cheesy but i really love this girl, i want her to remember that i'll never stop caring. recently, her car has been totaled so i haven't really been seeing her much like i used to. it's been about two months so far and every week i come by on the bus to see her and spend a couple days with her. she lives about 30 miles away so it's a definite i need to bus it trip. this week i managed to find her a ride here for our six months together and she's excited cause i planned it all out for her. i'm the first boyfriend shes ever had. she never dated anyone in high school so she got lucky with not having to deal with childish drama. we're going to frank and sons in the morning (her first time there), coming back to my place and relaxing with a nice massage (she loves them)  while we finish up our last four episode of game of thrones season three. i have an intention to cook, but since i've been taking the bus. my funds are low and i haven't been able to buy anything to cook with. so i'm stuck with easy mac and a cake that i baked for her. a pizza would really help me out so i can at least buy food for the rest of the weekend so we can eat and if i'm lucky have some left over for handel's (best ice cream ever). i just want to give her a relaxing day and weekend since she's been working so hard to pay for a new car. thanks for considering to read all of that if you did!
[] california, usa - birthday today, pizza sounds outworldly . playing blacklight: retribution, it's awesome. today is my 20th birthday, which is also awesome. i don't have any awesome food though, just ramen  and cheap mac'n'cheese. it's tragic as i get paid tomorrow! i just moved here to socal and none of my family knows my new address to send any possible cards. i've got $0.62 in my bank but i'm a registered caregiver for my mom so it's pretty relaxed here, her paycheck is rent, mine is everything else. broke till tomorrow, would fancy a pizza pie.

[] regular internet guy here.. i tried to do an askreddit a while back about a friend who faces time. it didn't do well so i deleted it. i guess that explains my user name.

i heard about this reddit through the same friend that introduced me to this reddit site.

i have some pics of my place. i don't do so well. my friend said i should use imgur.com.

edit: i read on sidebar. i am in us but my first language is not english.

[] wellington, new zealand.. yeah, just the usual i'm afraid. broke, payday isn't for a few more days and what little money i do have is going into basic necessities.
[] not dire, just looking for pick me up to hold me over until i can go grocery shopping late tonight.. i'm not really in a dire situation or anything at the moment, just mildly depressed at recent life events and waiting around until tonight when my brother (and only roommate) gets home from work and we can go grocery shopping.  wish my car would get fixed already, so i wouldn't be stranded like this!

unfortunately, we delayed this food run a little too long, and have run out of basically everything edible besides about a dozen apples and some eggs.  lol.  so yeah, i've been eating nothing but apples since i woke up about four hours ago.  why are these things so unfulfilling?!

anyway, i was talking about my situation in an irc channel and someone linked me this.  i've read reddit here and there, but never actually took the initiative to get an account or post anything.  but hey, nothing wrong with giving it a shot i guess.  not sure what exactly i can give for verification, if you guys would like any.  i assume you would, with me being a newly signed up member.  if you feel like throwing a pick me up my way, just let me know what i can do.

oh, i should probably note that i live in vegas.

[]i interviewed for what could be a life-changing position today. i'd like to celebrate.. i have no pity story. i'm not poor (well...i make enough to survive), and i'm not starving. i'd just really like to celebrate. i think i did pretty damn well in the interview, nerves aside. if i get the job, i'll be able to actually make some pizza dreams come true.  

i solemnly vow to randomly pay the random act of pizza forward. i'll probably buy somebody a pizza in the future anyway...but i'll make it my duty if a kind stranger were to hook me up. hell, might even throw in some wings or breadsticks.
[] food before work.. have a few hours to kill before i walk to work for the night. its kinda far but mostly i just like pizza. whatever i dont eat will stay at the house for my friend to eat when he gets home. its his house and all. have questions let me know.
[] barely made it through the summer without any hangups.. not to be cliche, but i'm a broke, last-year college student trying to get through the night. i would be more than willing to pay it back/forward after i get my check next week from my job. school starts tomorrow and i will have meal plans, so no worries for the rest of the semester. feel free to check my account, it's over three years old and i participated in secret santa and arbitrary day if that gives any credibility to my intent in hitting someone back. thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.
[]  is this true...?(:. so i am totally car-less. i wanted to know if this website is for real. free pizza?:d i'm up for that! i haven't had pizza in ages! i live in a town in the middle of absolutely nothing.  i can't drive anywhere. help?
 stuck w/ car troubles! tampa. never done this but, i was trying to get home this weekend for the holiday in daytona, but my car broke down and wont be fixed till after the holiday weekend! dont have any money to eat since i put it all into getting my car fixed! $220 so hungry, please help! 
[] used all of my money to fix my car so i don't get fired, so no grocery money. but there's good news too! (southern connecticut). just spent almost $1600 on my car to get it through emissions in order to renew the registration, which expired yesterday and also replace the waterpump which went at the same time. still need to wait until my next paycheck in order to afford to pay this year's car taxes and the renewal fee. i had to borrow money and use all of my check in order to cover it so far.

but the good news is, not only did i get a promotion at my full time job, i was also hired as a freelance on call artist for mac cosmetics, which pays much more than what i earn at my full time job. hopefully within the next two or three months i'll be in a place where i don't feel like i have to ask the internet for food and i can give away pizza like woah.

so this is kind of a desperately hungry/celebration pizza!

there's a pizza hut and dominos that both deliver near me. i'd seriously be grateful. thanks!
[]old friend in town, no food in house. philadelphia area.. hello raop

i have an old friend in town this weekend. he is stopping by later today to watch some football and hang out for a while. i have no real food in my house to offer while he is over here, and i don't get paid until the end of the week. i hate to be a bad host, could anyone help me out with a delicious pizza to feed us growing men? i will be paying it forward regardless at the end of the week.

i live in wilmington, de (right outside philadelphia). i have all the majors around, pizza hut, dominos, papa johns.

thanks for considering helping me out!!

[] sydney student going through rough patch.. hey reddit, i heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. i'm a 24 year old college student from south-west sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. things weren't always this difficult. i had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.

but now that i've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. i have depleted any savings i once had, and my credit cards are shot. i still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.

i rarely go out with friends because of my situation. i haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time i ate 3 square meals in a day. i might only have one meal a day, because i have to consciously ration the food and money i have. i even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so i can save money on haircuts. i have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.

it's kind of depressing actually. i never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.

i must admit, i had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza reddit before, but long story short... i'm starving. i'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as i don't want people to know how poor i am. however, if someone could help a brother out, i would forever be in-debt. its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. i would most certainly love to be able to "pay-it-back" to others who need help, when i get back on my feet (if i find my feet at all).



**update:**

[] completely broke, nothing in the fridge. help me reddit, you're my only hope. in dublin, ireland.. wages were supposed to be in my bank account this morning, they weren't. i am very hungry. i am happy to pay it back or forward when i get paid.

[] i've been on reddit forever and i want to try a new pizza.. i have been on /r/randomactsofpizza, and i always liked the idea but i was too scared. now i would like to try this for real, but i am starting off by requesting a pizza. i am a simple pepperoni type person, but i love trying new things.
 
this isn't a sob story of any kind, i just want a pizza. if you'd like, i am in the orange county **~*area*.**

i would love to pay this forward to someone some time. the idea of raop is awesome; giving the present of ooey-gooey-pizza goodness is amazing. 

i hope to get a redditor who expands my tastes! 

*p.s. i never had anchovies. i love all meats. cheese? please! lots.*
[] aus, girlfriend has been studying like a boss. would like to surprise her with pizza and give her a break.. 
[] queens, ny unemployed, in emergency mode until april 15th. would love to take a break from eating rice and beans. jobless, just paid rent (woohoo!), and need to pay few grand in taxes. it's been really tough to make ends meet these days. which also means i've been eating rice and beans twice a day, every single day.

last night i dreamed about eating pizza, with its warm sauce and melty cheese. today i get to eat...you guessed it...more rice! yay! 

i try to stay upbeat about what's been going on, but sometimes it's just hard to keep smiling. some real-life pizza would make this gloomy nyc afternoon much brighter. it really would make all the difference to me.

and of course, i'd love to pay it forward when my situation improves.
[]patheic, poor dad. no money. . i work as a sub-contractor and my boss decided to leave town when he owed me money for this week's work. i had been counting on that money because my kids are here until tuesdy night. my 7 yo daughter even mentioned how i never have anything good to eat here (it was completely innocent, but still hits home). glad to buy someone a pizza tuesday night... in need right now though. anyone? 
[] north central florida, usa (could use some pizza right now!). i'm saving up money to buy a new phone, and could really use a pizza right now. i haven't eaten anything other than the stuff i have at home, and could use a little change. i'd be glad to pay it forward once i buy this phone and have money to spend.

edited for redundancy.
[] pizza for my girlfriend with celiac disease.. hey, my girlfriend has celiac disease and hasn't had a pizza in a long time. but today we found out that domino's has gluten free pizza. i was wondering if anyone would be nice enough to order me one for her.

thanks!
[]  on behalf of my friend (mother of 2). **first let me say that i will provide any reasonable verification as to the validity of what i am going to say. just message me. i am very sorry for the pity parade, honestly, however my embarrassment is over weighed by my concerned for my friend and her family. if you have any advice that i can forward to her please private message me. thank you.**

so here is the situation:
i am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not reddit. she is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). she recently moved to glendale, az from florida. she was supposed to be able to stay with an in-law. that plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this friday. she has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. she has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). 

**so yes, long term, she will be ok.**

the problem, is that des hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. i am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where i am pretty sure she will be ok (and i will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't).

[] pizza for a student. so this is my roommate and my last night living together, we will both be going home which is about 3-4 hours apart. we've been friends since middle school and probably wont be able to hang out anymore (at least for a long time). we both recently left our jobs (i helped him get one on campus where i work). i worked their for 2 years and he worked there for a year. it would be nice to commemorate our final night of living together.
[] not much food until tomorrow.. i will go ahead and say that i got a pizza meal from here before as to not seem like i'm scamming anyone. i have been promised 2 well-paying jobs and one minimum wage + .40 to fill in the gaps of unemployment of a second job, if that makes sense, but i'm waiting until they call me in for that expendable job, a background check for one, and a test request for the other. i will be able to pay forward this one and the previous random act of pizza when i can get my life straight. i will pay the previous one forward whether i get food from this or not. didn't want to sound like i'm taking that promise to pay it forward hostage. anyway, it would benefit me, my roommate, his brother, and his mom greatly if we could get some pizza.

edit: not caring what trolls like francewinwars say, especially if all they do is convince people to not help the less-fortunate. if anyone wants to roll the dice and buy us pizza for the day, i will pay it forward as soon as i get spare cash, which should be within the next couple of months.
[] hungry and don't get paid till friday.. if someone would like to buy me a pizza i will gladly return the favor friday when i get paid! i just ran out of food and don't want to wait till friday to eat. thanks for considering!
[] ontario, canada out of money and ramen.. hey. i recently had my hours cut back at work, and have been struggling to find a second job to make up for the lost wages. i've had to cut down on my food budget in order to pay my bills, and have been eating nothing but ramen for the past month. i only have a few left, and i'm now out of money until friday. would be amazing if i could actually eat a real meal for once. thanks a lot.
[] i just lost my job, short on rent :(. yesterday i got laid off with a job i've been working for over a year now. my boyfriend hasn't been working for the past two months since he also got laid off working construction. i have no idea what we are going to do now..rent is due on the 5th at the latest and the next check i get wont be until the 12th. pretty much feeling shitty about everything right now, trying to figure out what i can do to get money quickly. plus my ph. is gonna be outta mins, my insurance, and internet bill is due...oh ya &gt;.&lt; ...could really use a random act of pizza.

[] broke canadian in need of food. if anyone is interested in my story here it is.
i was kicked out of my parent's home a few months ago for religious reasons and i'm struggling to make ends meet living on my own. my mormon parents don't talk to me and don't want to have anything to do with me after they found out i'm not going on my mission. i have a job and a room but my hours were weekends only last month and i'm completely broke until the end of this week when i get paid and even then, money is going to be tight for the next few months. i was not really prepared to live on my own like this (i just recently turned 20) and i'm really struggling. i'm trying to eat as little as i can to save as much money as i can and pizza would be amazing right now.

[] twenty year old between jobs and homes. i'm currently sitting at a mcdonalds, where i slept in my truck last night, with no gas and no money for food. i didn't get anything to eat yesterday, and so far today it's looking like it's gonna be the same way. there is a pizza hut within walking distance, and would really appreciate any kind of food. it really sucks to have to ask for something like this, but it's either this or go outside and beg for money face to face.

[] starving, and very broke, would really appreciate some help. dear reddit, i posted earlier but i didnt put request in the title so it was removed. here is my second attempt. so, today i finally met my first in person redditor and i have to say, it was amazing. (ive been a lurker since the whole digg v4 fiasco, but i decided to make an account a few days ago so i can be somebody in this community for once. anyway, she told me about this subreddit where if youre hungry, short on cash, or are willing to meet some sort of requirement, someone will order you a pizza. so heres my shot. basically im pretty broke at the moment. i live with a roommate but i really dont want to go through her fridge and be "that guy" who eats what he wants even if it isnt his. i make minimum wage (30hrs a wekk) in my state but luckily i work about 3 miles away so i dont spend much on fuel. i have 3 children and i was divorced almost a year ago. about half my monthly income goes to child support and random bills (i was an idiot and got a title loan at a desperate time in my life and i still have to pay a pretty hefty monthly payment for a few more months. my state says i make too much to receive food stamps so i have to pay for all my food with cash and also food for when i get my children on the weekends (i want to make sure they have 3 good healthy meals a day when theyre here). so heres where i ask, random_acts_of_pizza, will you please buy me some pizza, im sure it will be left overs and help me out through out the week until im payed on friday. im willing to do whatever tasks im needed to earn this pizza. i love reddit and all it stands for, especially subreddits like these (assistance, suicidewatch) i live in idaho if that helps any fellow idahoan redditors. thanks reddit.
[] just returned home from rehab, trying to stay clean, could go for a pizza.. i have battled addiction all of my adult life - i have had long clean times (2 years), short ones, i've overdosed 4 times, and been to a lot of rehabs. i just returned home from yet another one and am starting over, have been going to meetings, have a sponsor, just got a job (though won't see any wages from it for weeks) and things are generally looking up. i won't lie - i'm certainly not in dire straits, but i sure could go for a pizza today.
[ing] pizza for hungry family of 7...houston, tx. my name is alaina. i'm 6 months pregnant, and we need help. our family is large and we're running out of food. we won't receive our food stamps for another week, and no one has any money to even attempt to buy food. we're hot, hungry, and would be extremely grateful if we could receive anything.

**edit:** i'm willing to prove my situation via photos with date stamps in a pm.
[] [new zealand] down-on-my-luck and could go for any sort of pizza.. now i know just straight up asking for a pizza isn't really inventive or innovative, but i'm kinda just without any money at all and could go for one or two, saving the slices for a meal every so often.
i think you can probably buy a pizza online from the pizza hut or dominos nz branch near me from anywhere in the world, but if you're in nz that's even cooler.
anyway, yeah. thanks in advance. i can give you my steam name and we can have a few games to celebrate if you want, or i could give a little thanks on my youtube channel if that's what you'd like. i can't really offer much other than that, but yeah, enough rambling.
i guess pm me if you're willing? :d
() boyfriend's paycheck delayed bc of address change.... my boyfriend was supposed to get paid thursday, but at the first of this month we moved and spent all of his last check on moving costs and first months rent. we also bought some groceries, but only bought enough to last until this paycheck. it still hasn't come and we've run out of food. could we have a pizza? we only need one, and will gladly forward! 

btw, i'm his girlfriend, i don't have a job because i'm in school full-time. i have student aid, but didn't get any for my summer courses, so only have a limited amount. i used most of my funds to pay his student loans so we wouldn't get any fees, or i would be buying cook-able food! thank you guys soo much! (just saying...because, this is awesome).

[] the bf just lost his job, and my hours at work were cut. the rent is paid, the cats are fed, but we're stressing. a full meal tonight would go a long way to cheering us up and we'll gladly pay it forward as soon as we're able.. 
i work in a restaurant and my manager is firing people and cutting hours. i am now only going to be working steadily 2 days a week, and next week i go back to school, so finding a second job right away with any flexibility is gonna be difficult. the bf and i have irons in the fire, but we're stressing out and worried about how we're going to get by. a hot pizza and a reminder that acts of kindness are still occasionally possible in this world would go a long way toward cheering up our little family.  i'm in the louisville ky area. thanks reddit!

[] thought we would make it until payday then car trouble.... i posted yesterday but a very nice lady from work knew i was having some financial trouble and got us food for last night. so i deleted my request. today we are back in the same boat. like i stated yesterday, this is out of my comfort zone because i am usually the one trying to help somebody. my husband was laid off about 3 months ago and we usually are able to make it from check to check. i also take care of my grandmother how is disabled. but this week has been rough. my car broke down on tuesday. had to get a new battery and a couple of other small parts to get it back running. this set us back. we are now broke. we are going to try to have a yard sale tomorrow to get up a little money but have nothing for tonight. i am more than willing to pay this forward when i get paid again next friday july 15. thanks for your consideration.

[](tennessee) university student feeling somewhat iffy about finals. could use some pizza to eat while studying.. hello, raop. long time lurker, occasional commenter, first time poster.

in any case finals are looming in on me and, while i certainly have a chance to kick their ass and earn myself a 3.0 gpa this semester, i am still nervous. it is for this reason why i am requesting a pizza-- to have a little motivation and something delicious to eat while studying.

i will have money come in at the end of the month, so when that time comes i should be able to pay it forward. thanks so much for your consideration. :)

[] my folks and myself are on a gluten free diet, and have a craving for some domino's 'za!. my parents and i are on a gluten free diet (no flour/wheat - no pizza crust) and scraping toppings off just ain't my thing. domino's is the only place in the area with a gluten-free option, and it's pretty expensive. we would buy it ourselves, but our household is in a bit of a financial pickle. any help would be appreciated. thanks so much in advance!

[] things started going downhill a couple months ago... just looking for a bright spot. hi... i am new to this, so i hope i am doing it right. i live in central fl. my husband and i have 3 young children. my husband is a local truck driver and i am a stay-at-home mom. a couple months ago our roof decided to start leaking, right in to our bedroom. insurance isn't covering it because the roof is old. we are trying to save to repair the roof and replace the drywall that was damaged. since that time, things have continued to spiral downward. i don't want to be long winded, but it has gone so far that we have had to apply for foodstamps and medicaid because i have 2 have surgery and a diagnostic procedure to rule out cervical cancer. my husband's wages have been cut because the runs just aren't there. we are struggling and the only way that we have had any food for the past couple of weeks is because of my parents. i have been looking for a job, but i have had no success. we are even having to sell our electronics on craigslist to try and get some money to survive. it has been very stressful and frustrating for us and i know our kids can tell that something is wrong. i was hoping that someone might be willing to give us just one bright spot in this dark time. thanks for taking the time to read all of this. blessings to you all. :0)
[] finally got a job, would love to celebrate!. after a particularly ill-timed lay-off, i've finally found a new job! not only that, but it looks like the lay-off might have been a blessing in disguise, because this job seems amazing!

unfortunately, i don't get paid for a while. while i have some left-overs i could eat, i'd love to be able to celebrate with a delicious pizza! (and of course, the first new paycheck will have me celebrating again by paying the pizza-giving forward!)

thanks, everyone!

[] northern co injured and can't work, don't get paid until thursday night. hi guys, earlier this week i tore or otherwise really messed up a tendon in my shoulder while at work. i just spent the last of my cash putting gas in my roommate's car so he can get to work. i'm down to chocolate milk, dry rice and canned peas until i get paid tomorrow (thursday) night and i'm in too much pain to even use my dominant hand to type, let alone use pots and pans and try to cook something that doesnt even seem worth eating to begin with. and of course a pay it forward or a thank you pizza for the donator will be the least i can do, guaranteed by end of day saturday.

i appreciate your time, this took me a long time to type with only my non-dominant hand &gt;.&lt;
[] been stuck at home for three weeks would love a pie. i've been home bound with our dog who needs hip surgery while my grandma is in the hospital with her knee. tired of frozen dinners :(
[] utterly defeated. so here's the micro story: lost my job in florida, moved back up near family in wisconsin and into a motel, had to changed to an even cheaper motel so now living in rockford, il. i'm now away from family, no friends, and yesterday my car broke down. i am a freelance web developer, so thankfully i can do my work as long as i have internet. but finding work is another story. 

i have 89 cents to my name until who-knows-when. unfortunately where i live, there are no places that deliver. since my car's broken, i'm not sure i could even do pizza. i was thinking, if i could find the cash, i would walk to the nearest gas station and stock up on pasta-type stuff. 

so if anyone out there is willing to help, i would be so very much appreciative. if you have questions on anything, feel free to ask. i have verification as well. 

thank you everyone for your consideration.

[] las vegas, nv. out of work since jan 30, don't get my first check until friday. is anyone able to help?. ~~title basically says it all. unexpectedly lost my job at the end of january. i interviewed and got a new job around feb 14-15, but didn't start until march 8th. only just barely had enough to cover rent, bills, and a few~~ ~~groceries. i'll get my first check friday morning, but i've been eating ramen for the last week and would really~~ ~~love some cheesy goodness.~~

[] college grad unemployed roommates. my roommate and i are both college graduates who have not managed to find employment yet, just looking for a good pizza! will post pic with thanks, and pay it forward!
[] got laid off with no severance yesterday. happy holidays!. i really hate asking for handouts and if i wasn't married, i probably wouldn't bother. but yesterday, i got laid off. not only did i not get any severance pay, my boss also gave me a 1-week, mandatory, unpaid "vacation" prior to the layoff. 

they had told me to "enjoy a week off for thanksgiving and spend time with your family." that was nice, i figured my christmas bonus will make up for the 40-hour loss. then i come back ready to work, 2 days later i get the boot. keep in mind, this is 2 weeks before christmas bonuses go out. 

so i lost 1 week of pay, no severance, no bonus, and no job. my wife is a full-time college student that isn't even allowed to work (she will lose her scholarships.)

this is going to be a very tight and hungry christmas for my wife and i. and we would greatly appreciate something good to eat so i can use what money i have left to pay bills until i find another job.

if you need proof, i'd be happy to tell you anything. we are a very generous couple and once i get another job, i would be happy to pay it forward.


located in eugene, oregon

[] just need a little help with dinner since i'm broke and struggling. pizza would make me so happy in my tummy! (texas). i'm broke for another two weeks and so dang hungry for some good eats. i paid my rent today, and got my phone turned back on, and now i've got nada to last me until my next check. not to mention, i owe some money to the bank due to some ridiculous overdraft fees that i did not intentionally incur. my rent check was cashed by my landlord really late, after i thought he'd already taken it out a while back. i had to ask my roommate to cover the utility bills until i can pay my half later (i'll be sharing the possible pizza with her too, she's an angel). 

i'm steadily working on a film my friends and i are making, which i love, but buying supplies for what i want/need to do along with paying my bills has left me in a bit of a rut. frankly, i fucked up on my budget. i have an interview for a second job tomorrow, which i'm pretty stoked about.

[] help out a broke student?. hey guys,

i've made my way in to uni at 8:30pm to work on assignments and get ahead in general. i came straight from a netball game to here, so haven't eaten a thing since lunch.

to explain the title, i am absolutely and completely broke in terms of both spirit and cash. the year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.

i was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. my annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and i was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. the annual leave payout was a lot less than i anticipated, as i was taxed a lot, meaning i could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me i may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. i've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. i made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and i put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since. 

my car rego is now overdue, i have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when i run out of petrol (i have about half a tank at the moment) i have no idea how i'm going to get to and from uni, and i have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on friday. not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which i'm now starting to get payment reminders for.

the reason i'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, i'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. i've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what i'm going to do when i need to start making rent payments again. not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.

please help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night. when a source of income comes in, i am more than happy to return the favour. when i do have money, i try to regularly made it a habit to help people out. i'm also happy to fulfil requests, but bear in mind that i'm at uni.

thanks in advance =)

[] michigan, usa very low on food would loved to be blessed with cheesy goodness. hello fellow redditors things have been tough but i know they will get better eventually. was wondering if a kind and thoughtful soul could help a family of 5 with a decent meal this friday evening. food is almost nil around here and will not be able to buy any until monday. there are 5 of us. 2 adults, and 3 children if anyone can help. we have a pizza hut that is not too far from the house so an egift card would be perfect. i want to thank you all so much for reading my post.

[] ny usa would love to help me through a stressful week. my mother lives in the area effected by the giant little bear fire in new mexico and is waiting to hear if she has a place to live or is coming back to new york to live with me. my father lost his job several month ago and is also likely about to move in with me. these two have been divorced for 20+ years and as much as i love them i have no idea if i can handle that. so i'm sitting here stressed out already wondering if i have enough to survive this economic hellstorm myself, let alone save my parents. i would love a pizza right now.
[] broke until i get a job, pantry is bare.. hey, i don't have a lot of food around the house at the moment, and i probably won't be getting a paycheck for a few weeks at least, so i'm asking if one of you kind redditors would like to buy this bloke a pizza.

many thanks in advance.
[] hungry and without money/job, could go for a pizza to tie me over today. i was stupidly laid off of my last job and have been without work for the past two months. i could definitely go for a pizza. in return i'll send you something precious of your choosing.


**edit:** i live in kansas. close friends with the kents. haven't seen clark around lately. would love a pizza instead.
[] help me start 2012 with a pizza.... or i will just be forced to eat food at my work, and we only sell popcorn and pretzels. i hardly ever eat anything other than food from my work because i barely ever have extra money and i feel guilty buying food when i can eat that stuff for free. i make ten cents over minimum wage at my job and had to work 72 hours in the past two weeks so i could pay my rent. i just got paid yesterday and all but $27 of my paycheck has to go towards rent tomorrow. i will only have that $27 for the next two weeks. i feel bad asking for charity but i hope someone out there will take pity on me and buy me something delicious. thank you!
[] orange county, ca, usa - budgeting mishap = no food. long time occasional lurker, first time poster here. i am 21, a recent college graduate, who managed to land a game programming job prior to graduating (and by luck my job actually pays well), however this month when trying to get ahead in tuition loan payments and spending a bit to try to get into basic electronics engineering as a hobby i managed to somehow end up in quite the situation. due to a compounding of unexpected expenses, netflix pulling money out of the wrong (and empty) account, a rather large (at least for me) loan payment, and well simply an outright failure to budget this month... i managed to become absolutely broke aside from the bare minimum i need to get to work once this week (i work from home mostly as well). 

for the past week i've been limited to the scarce quanitity of frozen meals that i bought about two weeks prior, however three weeks ago for what ever reason i acquired a large amount of soda. i ran out of food two days ago and my only intake since then has been soda. at first i was like, "no big deal, i get paid in a few days", but that has turned into "maybe if i use these nail clippers i can carve a hole in this 360 controller to live in this soda can collection" mental instability.

long story short, i have no karma, no food, but get paid in about 3-6 days (my job is slowly moving to direct deposit but hasn't set me up yet...) and i would really like a pizza. in exchange, i'd be more than willing to pay you back as soon as i get paid, or do some small task of some reasonable sort.

i prefer dominos, a medium pizza and a "build your own breadbowl pasta" (usually a coupon deal online) can last me almost two days, but really i'll take whatever i can get as i'm not exactly in a position to choose.

heres a link to my outdated blog for some loose type of verification? (i also have one of those verification system code things as well).

[] aiken, sc. happy veterans day! i'd like to make a request that someone out there make ramen illegal. my family and i have eaten nothing but ramen for a week and it has slowly but surely drained everyone in my household. we try dressing it up with canned sauce, but it's still really bad. can you help a brotha out with something that doesn't taste like wet cardboard tonight? my wife, kids, and myself would appreciate the kind gesture. my kids can also make you a you tube video if you like laughing at silly things. nothing too graphic or obscene (they're 10 and 12), but i'm sure they can make you a funny video of just about whatever you like within reason. (daddy has to approve of the theme.)

if you can't help, thank you for checking out my post. i was joking about ramen being a crime - we are thankful to have it, but wish we could have something different. thank you and hope ya'll enjoy your friday. 
[] hoping for a pizza. i really hate to do this. i am not the type of person to ask people for help...ever. however, i am 21 years old and i live on my own. i make minimum wage and i always make sure to pay all of my bills on time. unfortunately, once all my bills are paid...there is not always money left over for food. i'm not exactly sure how this all works but i thought it was worth a try. i don't get paid again until next thursday but i will survive if i don't get a pizza. i have 0$ to my name but it is not a big deal because i don't drive or anything. so really all i need is a little bit of food. if someone would be willing to help me out that would be awesome and i would be totally willing to pay it forward to someone else in need in the future when i am able to. thanks for reading this. this is a humbling experience!oh yeah and by the way i do it all on my own with no government assistance and have been since i was 17 years old. not sure if that really makes a difference or not...
[] texas, usa: $10 left to my name, and i haven't eaten all day. i'd love a small pizza in exchange for my eternal gratitude (or a dota 2 invite). title says it all... i had some unexpected expenses today that drained me of my money for the rest of the week. haven't eaten since i had a cup of yogurt about 13 hours go and i'm startin' to feel it. if anyone is able to help me out with a small pepperoni i'd truly appreciate it, and if you're into gaming i can shoot you an invite to dota 2!

[] *generic "i'm starving" title*. hey guys,

i promised myself i wouldn't do this because i'd feel terrible, but after not eating anything for the past days (except german chocolate), i figured i would at least try this. 

so here's the [true] story: student (of course), living in canada (parents live in michigan]. i am absolutely broke as my most recent funds were drained into parking tickets and a plane ticket for my brother's wedding. 

i'm not going to complain that my situation is worse than anyone else's-- i have my sweet hamster asleep on my leg and i have season 4 of 30 rock, so i'm bearing with it. *swallows pride* but i'm starving. if you're generous enough to send me pizza, give me your address and as soon as i have money for shipping i will send you out all the german chocolate i have, as well as a post card and a bag of reeses peanut butter cups. i will do anything to make it even with you. and be your pen pal. :)

thanks in advance. seriously. 
[] a couple of pies...maybe?. i have a coupon for papa johns which gives 50% off for pizza. that's two large pepperoni for less than 15 bucks. sadly a bit beyond my financial means at the moment. it would go a long way toward dinner for a few days.


[] phx something for me and the roomies. its been a while since i've been on a site where random people can get together and contribute something real.  i miss the days when bots in a chat room (that most people goto irc doesn't count, those bots are friendly) were a minority, . 

myself and room mates do a lot of donation of our time and limited resources, helping those less fortunate that showed up at the occupi.  
when we have an abundance we try to make the trickle down thing work, but it is tough to do with food, preparing, freshness...

the local z-pizza is good.  1 roommate is vegetarian, and 1 is vegan.  they aren't the picky type they just take the meat of and give it to me.

also if someone at the pizza place drew something funny on the box the we'd appreciate a good laugh. will post pix of pizza box.
[] because i'm not sure this even works. been playing blops2 all day, and now require sustenance to proceed.. i doubt anyone will send. but if you do, i'd be happy to take pics of me enjoying the pizza. i like italian sausage and bacon.

i am a contract programmer, and have been waiting over a week and a half for canada post to deliver at least one of my recent pay cheques.

so far i've managed to get by on a bit of groceries i had in my cupboard and from the food bank... but these supplies have unfortunately run dry.

every day, i check the mail like an eager kid waiting for that parcel he ordered from the back of a comic book... but so far, nothing.

i tend to be really generous when i do have cash and have bought many meals for hungry folks... and will certainly be putting up an [offer] post in here when my cheques finally do arrive.

if anyone out there sympathizes with the daily sinking heart feeling of waiting for that *special and important piece of mail*... please help a brother out?

thanks guys!

[] hungry dad with no food in kent, wa. hello everyone,

this is my first time here, i have just heard about it and decided to give it a shot since i have little food.

i live in kent, wa and we just had a really big snowstorm which put my apartment out of power for 5 days, as well as about 400,000 other homes. i have already been struggling and what little food i had frozen has now been spoiled, even the milk in my refridgerator. i live pay check to pay check and i did not anticipate this, i do not even have the money to purchase a gallon of milk.

i was hoping one of the kind souls out there could gift me a pizza that i could enjoy with my son, it would really help so much as all we have is about 6 cup of noodles and 2 boxes of mac and cheese (with no milk) to make it until payday this friday.

if somebody could help me out i would be so happy, pizza from anywhere, it doesn't matter... just something to eat.

i would gladly repay the favor forward when i get paid and gift somebody else in need.

thank you for listening,
mikey

[] fetus in dallas is causing mother to crave pizza.... dear raop, i am a freelance graphic/web designer working out of my apartment in fabulous dallas, tx. i also happen to be about 9 weeks 5 days pregnant with my first child. i am extremely hungry, and nothing in my kitchen is doing it for my cravings. (any pregnant/former pregnant women know what i am talking about!) i have tried to reason with oran/orenda and let s/he know that mama hasn't gotten paid yet, and cannot obtain the pineapple and tomato sauce that seems amazing. however, reasoning does nothing for hormones and fetuses, so i turn to you guys at random acts of pizza. can someone help, and i will gladly pay it forward/back come friday!

proof of an ultrasound can be provided upon request

***request answered thanks jeffreydonger***
: broke recent college grad, -$14.59 in my bank account. i'm broke as a joke and starving right now.  i've used up the little money i had left over the past few weeks, and don't really know how i'm going to make it through the next few weeks.

i would love to sit down with a nice warm pizza tonight and just say f**k it all.
[] hungry, unemployed and alone in los angeles.. so, raop, i've been unemployed now for 4 months, barely getting by on my unemployment. surviving, but the jobs aren't looking up. anyone that can help or be kind, i'd love it. you'd make my week. 
[] pizza to tide a nc college student over? willing to repay or pay forward later this year.... been having a very rough time with a few surprise expenses and i have incoming income but it won't be here for about a week. i'm not exactly at "ramen is all i have" status but potatoes, beans, rice, and cream o' wheat will only go so far and a pizza will hold me over for darn near 3 days before i actually finish it. would anyone care to show me some pizza love?

fair warning: i may decide to try to talk you out of it if you try to help... don't let me. it's something between pride and optimism... :)

[] about to have an all night study session in the library and could really go for some pizza. i'm a college student with a midterm worth 30% of my grade tomorrow morning as well as two papers due. it looks like i'll be spending the whole night in the library working, and i could really go for some pizza. i am located in wisconsin (usa) and papa johns is located on campus. if anyone would be willing to donate a pizza, i'd really appreciate it!

[] sacramento, ca: i just want some pizza. i have no noble cause to rally any givers to. i am not in absolute need, but i am completely broke and in debt, with a somewhat empty fridge. i am not starving, i have bread and canned goods. i mostly just want some pizza, because pizza is awesome and i'm hungry. getting over a sunburn so bad i couldn't walk (swelling), if that helps.


all in all, there are better people to get pizza for. but i still want some.

[] los angeles -- would love to surprise my girlfriend. can you help make it a date night?

here's the sitch (is that how you abbreviate it? i know how it's said, but i don't think i've seen it in writing....)

my girlfriend has been working hard to support us since i lost my job. long hours, crappy boss, you know the drill. 

about an hour ago i just got a short gig, so i can start to contribute again, but it will still be a while before we're back on our feet completely.

as i feel it is my boyfriendly duty, the least i can do for everything she does, i give her a lot of massages. back, neck, arms, feet, i do it all baby! i'm rubbing those knots out like nobody's business.

but now my hands remind me of my grandpa's (except the skin doesn't look paper thin). knuckles the size of cherries, stiff as a board. ok so that's quite an exaggeration, they don't really hurt. but still.

i would love to be able to have a pizza tonight with her, as a sort of thank you type date thing, since we don't always get to eat together and it's never something you find on /r/foodporn 

[] been job hunting for a while, and just really bummed out.. lost my job in august. was my own damn fault but still have not found anything.. just feelin a little bummy and need some comfort food.
[] student dreaming of a lovely cheese pizza, just for me!. i don't eat the baby animals but i do enjoy me some cheese. vegetable are for salads.

[ uk london] fuck you tesco brand spaghetti, beans, and soup!. so i've been functionally poor for ages now and i didn't realise how long ago it's been since i had pizza until today where i've been hit with an immense craving. i'm not here to boo hoo about how it sucks to have no cash - so many people here have it so much worse than me and i'm lucky just to be able to keep my shit together to the point where i've got a roof over my head.

anyway - i'm sick to death of supermarket own brand tins of crap and bread that's a day out of date (but 15-20p so bargain, right?). allow me to have some pizza and allay my fate.

also seeing as pizza hut keep posting vouchers through my door i figured i'd better ask before i forcible return them to sender with a vengeance.

edit: i have nothing else to do with my time so i'm just going to chill and wait here :)

edit 2: appreciating the support everyone!
[] englewood, fl. it's the day before payday and my girlfriend and i are craving some howie's. our roommates are probably about to cook something tasty that they will not be willing to share as we are not on the best of terms with each other. i think a large pepperoni pizza and one of our blu-rays would make for an enjoyable night. thanks, guys.
[]. zalodad and myself would love to have a pizza with our kids tonight! my husband lost his job, our food stamps haven't come in yet and i don't get paid till next week. plus we have only a couple of dollars for gas and hardly anything in the pantry. if you could help, we would appreciate it! :) 
[] pizza for a couple in mesa, az. my fiance chris and i (laura) just moved across town to a new apartment. unfortunately we got screwed over by the moving company (quoted us around $30 for the truck, costed $80 -.-;) and we barely have enough money to get by until pay day (aug. 1st). i can barely move let alone cook anything and chris is in worse shape than i am. we would greatly, greatly appreciate even just a single cheap-o cheese pizza so we can eat. please help. :(
[]single mother, pizza would boost spirits. my foodstamps come in on the 8th and i have 13 dollars of it left. it would be nice to have some piece of mind for a night. i don't really want to broadcast my life and what is going on but if you would like to know for some legitimacy i can tell you. i just need some cheering up and have someone nice to come along to keep my faith up.

-edit-
i'm in lakewood/denver co area
[] pessimism dies hard &amp; 1st world problems.... i am really encouraged by this subreddit but am still a bit disbelieving that random strangers are so willing to help one another.  i am a major pessimist and, while i try not to be, i almost always tend to think the worst eventuality will happen at any given moment.  so, here we are.  i am supposed to start online classes for my master's degree on monday and i actually have to ship my computer off for repairs because it is seriously messed up and the warranty ends in 10 days.  :( sigh, it's not so much the inconvenience of going to the library, etc.  it is just that i feel like anytime i take a step forward, i get kicked two steps back.  

a hot pizza on a saturday night would pick up my spirits a bit and my husband would also definitely enjoy it.  he works as a cook and is always exhausted once he comes homes.  the last thing he wants to do is cook dinner and i am a bit of a kitchen nightmare. 

thanks guys!

[] columbia, sc. haven't had a pizza in awhile and have only .88 in the bank account. student, had a test today and couldn't get to the plasma donation center in time so i could eat today.  a pizza would really hit the spot and tide me over until i can get some cash in the next few days and pay it forward.  thanks for any considerations or help.

[] broke teenager waiting on food stamps. i live in california. hey. im 19 and i live in california. im inbetween jobs and waiting on my ebt card. i have no money at the moment. a pizza would really help fill an empty stomach
[not_a_] i wish i had heard of this subreddit back in july. long story short, i basically ran out of money back in late june. i spent essentially the entire month of july eating things like empty taco shells for dinner, my roommate's scraps from the night before for breakfast, and some days simply eating nothing. yes i know boo-hoo, just wanted to say i found this subreddit today and it's one of the best ones!

again, i do not want a pizza, only giving props to an awesome sub. you guys are kewl.
moved to a new city []. just moved to columbia, sc...i start my job on next monday and am a little tight on cash to say the least with rent due this week. would appreciate a random act of pizza (kindness) to help out one night. 23 years old and just starting out! thank you for reading!
pregnant woman that has been laid off..not a .. i just want to say that hearing about this site today warms my heart.  i was laid off from my job and still trying to find a new one.  i'm only 3 months pregnant but not having any money that could be quite a scare. i'd like to say by the grace of god today there is food in the fridge thanks to food stamps.  but there were definitely times where a pizza would have lifted my spirits, and the fact that there are people here doing just that for others, you are all amazing.  if i had the funds right now to make an offer i would be doing so as well.  but let's just hope i don't need to make any requests anytime soon.  i just wanted to tell you all that you are great people. 
[] just moved into a new apartment in ny, and the fridge is empty until saturday ;_;. i had to take the week off in order to move in, so i didn't bring home any tips which would normally get me through. if i could get a pizza to hold me over the next evening and lunch/dinner tomorrow, i could make it last until saturday and have enough money to pay it forward on demand.

if anyone could help me out, i would be so incredibly grateful and if there is any way i could help you out even besides a random act of pizza, i'll do what i can to the best of my ability (provided it is completely reasonable; i'm sure i can take out an entire high rise of elite bodyguards guarding your kidnapped grandmother, but i don't really have the time for it in my schedule).
[] columbus, ohio - need help cheering my girlfriend up. i've just gotten back from holiday today (greece) which was a clusterfuck of disasters - i was robbed, my iphone stolen and my money, and have several stitches above my eye to boot. while i was away my girlfriend had her apartment broken into by a lone male and she woke up with him assaulting her luckily she screamed and he was frightened away by her housemate running in, but it could have been a lot worse. 

she has some facial bruising and bruises to her hands, and from talking to her on the phone tonight she is pretty terrified. as a backstory, my girlfriend is from my town but is working 3500 miles away in columbus, ohio, until the end of next year, meaning i cant be there to make her feel better  &amp; thanks to my mishaps while abroad, i have no money to do anything about it and no way to talk to her other than landline calling (we've tried skype but it drops constantly - facetime is a dream come true for us but it will be around 20 days til my insurance coughs up for a replacement phone, so its going to be a nightmare until then!)

so basically i'd like some help in cheering up the poor girl. for obvious reasons giving her address out on the internet right now would be a big no-no, but i'm not sure if there is any other way to do it? if there isnt, then can someone from there give me some pointers on an online site i can order for her? i don't mind racking up some over limit fees if it comes to it &amp; last thing i want to do is come across as a scammer. (you can see i did post an askreddit about the incident yesterday, alas it didn't get a single reply! img-foreveralone).

if anyone can help, i'd really appreciate it. thanks
[] moved out with my little sister. hungry/poor. my little sister and i got an apartment together in westminster, ca because all of our family moved to idaho. things are going great, except we don't have a refrigerator or any extra money for food. a pizza, or anything at this point, would really do the trick. we are asking for free food on the internet out of desperation. i wish i could give out pizza
[] atlanta ga would love a pizza tonight!. i'm in covington.  if anyone would give the gift of pizza, i'd be most most appreciative.  i'm a broke writer who only had ramen in his house.  thanks!
[] new to reddit, mom has no money, tired of ramen. hey guys, i'm in a tough situation and my mom has no money. she gets paid every second wed. of the month and i've had ramen noodles and mac n cheese for the past week for lunch and dinner. it would be amazing if someone can help me out. i would be willing to barter with pics of my cat doing goofy stuff. 
[] belgian student cut off by parents for enlisting at drama school, hasn't eaten in 24h, sick of and out of rice. . i never thought it would come to this but i'm trying my luck.

i told my parents about 2 weeks ago that i enlisted for drama school next year instead of finding a job with my masters in communication science that i'm graduating end of this semester. 

they promptly threw me out of the house and told me i could go do street theater if i ever needed money. i would if it wasn't -2° out. 4 years ago they told me the same about communication, except they told me if i need money i could go write about lost cats in the local paper. 

been out of money for 10 days now and my parents and sister are not picking up their phones, so they seem pretty serious about it. but i'm set on doing this. 

i'll be getting a paycheck in about a week but i'm out of rice and pasta. i'd be enormously grateful and would do anything for a pizza right now. 

[i see there's an international ordering guide in the sidebar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza/comments/ns3dj/the_definitive_guide_to_ordering_internationally/) i'd be more than willing to guide you through the process of ordering, which should be fine with a credit card. you'd be ordering from www.just-eat.be which has always been reliable and is always a safe bet for the student population here.

i'm counting on your random act of kindness to not let me go to bed hungry two nights in a row.

thank you and my apologies for the tearjerking. my parents will turn around soon, so it'll be fine.
[] pennsylvania. way too hot inside to cook, and we cant afford to eat out.. my girlfriend and i are living in a trailer with my brother while we go to school. if any of you have lived in a trailer, you should know that a little bit of heat goes a long way, especially when there is no ac (which is our case). turning on the stove or oven raises the temperature to the point where my greatest fear becomes spontaneous combustion. i'd be glad to pay it forward when i can!
[] i was known as pizza girl by the police at my university. i was once banned from a domino's for several pizza-related incidents.  help me show domino's that pizza girl's legacy will live forever!. my obsession with pizza actually scares people. this would be the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  
[] i'll write a song for a pie. (poughkeepsie, ny). i'll write it about whatever you like. i'm a songwriter so you're getting a real, quality song. for the sake of time, i'll write it on an acoustic guitar and record a video. if you want better quality after that; i can record it for you.

i woke up dying for a pizza but it's one of those "broke 'til payday" weeks. it'll be much appreciated!
[] california broke college student: no blocks, no food will draw you as a superhero in return. . i ate the last of my pb&amp;j sandwich fixings yesterday and my mom isn't able to buy me more meal blocks until wednesday. i'll draw a kick ass picture of you as a superhero if you feed me :)

my money situation is about as crappy as it can possibly be, but i will buy someone a fat, loaded pizza as soon as i'm able, i promise. i love this subreddit and what it's all about.

[]more than just pizza. hi guys, if you are like me then pizza is more to you then just a good food, it reminds you of a time when life was different, when you would hang out with all your friends when that new n64 game or playstation game came out and stay up all night playing it(conquersmplayer) . before a time when you had to deal with constant rejection from employers, money problems, rent and bills. if there was ever a time in my life when a pizza would mean alot, that time is now. also me and my roommate have been eating white rice exclusively for the past two months. well thats how i see it sorry for long post just wanted to say how i feel, thanks guys!

i am a father and husband that has been looking for employment after being laid off for some time now.  there has not been much success and my wife has been carrying all the weight.  it has definitely been a struggle to see her work so hard without being able to help. 

we have literally ran out of food today and must wait for her pay day to come on thursday.  she remains positive that we will be okay even when i feel we are about to crumble. 

looking for help to say thank you to her with a pizza for dinner. 

please help.  

thank you so much!
[]! would like to surprise my roommate! she helped me pass my finals!!. just finished up my summer finals! i took very difficult classes but i passed thanks to my lovely roommate. she helped me these past 6 weeks but know i want to thank her!! i don't have expendable money since i am a student so i am asking if someone could help me show her that i am thankful! i will try to return the favor as soon as i get a job!
[] may i have a pizza please?. so my mom is without electricity for a week so my sister and her friend along with my mom are staying over here so they don't have to deal with this heat. my mom just started her new job and i got fired at mine a week ago :'( (have applied everywhere and am pretty much now harassing places hoping to get hired) i am currently without money and my mom doesn't have enough to buy dinner so i am coming to reddit for some help. i am in an area where there isn't much selection and i don't think the closest place (which is pizza hut) delivers out here but i do have gas to pick it up. thanks.

my husband and i live on a military base. we don't get paid until in the am of tomorrow and we are down to no food and 47 cents in our checking. we are so broke because of me. i have illnesses that require medication that our insurance doesn't cover, as they only cover generic. this man has given everything to me and wants to take care of me. i wish i could do the same for him. so please, we need our faith in strangers restored. we will do the same. please.

[] pantry, fridge, and freezer are empty until next week. could anyone help out my small family with a pizza? va,usa. i'm somewhat nervous about posting, and hopefully i'll get a reply. my mom basically got gyped on her already insufficient paycheck. our fridge is almost totally empty, as our pantry and freezer. we've already borrowed money from my aunt so we could make tacos.. just going through a really rough time. could someone honor us with a raop?

[] autopay took all of my money! wv. i don't know what's going on, but i came home today and there's no check in my bank account. i was suppose to get paid on friday, but of course it was a holiday. i expected it to go in today, but it didn't. and payroll is closed today, so i won't know till monday. netflix took the last $16 out of my bank account yesterday, so i'm negative 10 cents now. i'm pretty sure my money will go in monday, but until then i'm out of food. is there anyway somebody can send a pizza, some wings, or anything just to tide me over until monday? i don't have any kids or anything like that it's just me, but i only go grocery shopping every 2 weeks. so not being able to go yesterday left me with very little to work with. i would greatly appreciate any help anyone could provide. thank you for reading.

[] gas got shut off and i am out of work in chicago. i really need a pizza(and job). my gas got shut off, i owe a grand to the electric company, i haven't paid my student loan bill in full in months and i have been out of work too long now, even though i have been applying to dozens of jobs a day and am signed up with temping agencies, have a bachelors... i can only afford to eat about once a day now as it is and i can't stop thinking about pizza, which would be a dream at this point. 

i am doing everything i can to try to make ends meet, i work for family, friends, temp, hang it technician fliers around town, but since i lost my job every other opportunity has seemed to dry up in chicago. i have an interview tomorrow for a paying internship and i would love to be able to walk in there on a full stomach.

being chicago, there are hundreds of pizza places and i am not a picky guy but if you were going to buy me a pizza please don't pizza troll me with anchovies :p i like meat and veggies and would be so grateful if someone could help me take my mind of all the shit that's going on in my life right now with a hot dinner.

[] i'd like to get a pizza dinner for myself, dad, step-mom this evening, but i don't get $ till wednesday. (sacramento, ca). a friend told me that this subreddit exists. that alone has made my evening. i don't really know how this works, but i figured it cannot hurt to post a request.

i don't have much to offer in return, aside from my gratitude and the promise that when i have cash on hand i'll pay it forward. i just recently moved back in with my dad and step-mom after life took a bit of a turn, and being able to show up with dinner would be great for both them and me.

[] massachusetts usa - college kids in need of pizza. my roomie and i are starving, a pizza would help boost morals around finals time!
[] i live with hoarders, and as of late my kitchen has become infested and unbearable.. pretty much the title. the family in my household are much older, and also hoarders, and recently my kitchen has become very disgusting due to a fuit fly infestation. aside from physiologically messing me up, it kind of also makes eating or preparing anything in the kitchen unbearable with a hundred little disgusting flys buzzing around. they have always been hoarders, but the past couple years the living standard has gone down pretty bad in this place..

 i plan to spend tomorrow really getting in there and doing some damage(cleaning wise), they even managed to get into and breed in the microwave. 

needless to say, i have been eating out a lot more than usual(mcdonalds dollar menu is a godsend) and it's killing my bank, which approximately now has 1 dollar and something cents, or else i'd order myself pizza.

so i  have my verification code and would be tremendously grateful for this act not to mention making sure to return the favor when i have more cash at hand(poor college student, ofcourse) to another unlucky individual. 

thanks for your time.

[] ashamed of myself and desperate for a handout. carol city, florida.. i got no one to blame for my situation but myself. i've been unemployed for a couple of weeks now after quitting my job at the mall over some really petty garbage. i was an idiot for doing it and now i've put myself in a place where i'm sinking fast. i've got no money, bills are okay but that wont last long, and i've got almost nothing in the way of food. my family doesn't speak to me anymore because i came out two years ago, so i can't fall back on them. i don't even know where my brother moved to last year, he didn't tell me before he left. 

i go to to school full time at bcc and without income the gas money getting to the campus in downtown ft lauderdale three days a week is killing me. i have interviews lined up but there's no telling how long it will be before i get another check. i'm really ashamed of myself for thinking i could just quit and find a new job overnight. i haven't told any of my friends yet but i'm going to have to if nothing changes for me. the sooner the better i know, but i'm just terrified of telling them how badly i'm doing right now. 

i'm asking for a handout in a big way because i've got nothing going for me right now. even my grades aren't that great this semester. can anyone on here help me this one time?

[] broke veteran student. i got out of the marine corps several months ago. i am from texas, and for the past few months i've been preparing to start college in florida. the original plan was i would drive here to florida, take a test, then return home and do my coursework online for the first 90 days, which would give me time to pull the funds together for the move to florida. unfortunately, they failed to inform me that the online option only applies to students who do exceptionally well on that test, which i did not. just for the first trip, i had to sell something that was very important to me. then i took the test and they told me i either had to give up my dream of becoming a student at their university, or move to florida immediately. i returned to texas and did everything i could think of to raise money for the early move, and in a final act of desperation, i sold even more of my belongings. now i am in florida, with 2 boxes of clothes, sleeping on a fellow classmate's (who also has no money) couch, with $2.00 in my wallet, wondering what i will do for food for the next 30 days, which is when my veteran's benefits kick in and i will finally be able to afford to eat. i would love it and greatly appreciate it if some kind soul would buy me a pizza to enjoy tonight.
[] no power, hungry!. our power is out, my other 3 roommates have family in the area to stay with except for me.  i have no way to cook and can't afford to go to a restaurant until i get paid. please help if you can!

[] new jersey, usa. two poor college kids that could use a bite to eat.... hey fellow pizza-lovers. 

it is coming to the end of the semester and i am about at my breaking point. me and my roommate are bio majors (senior year) and we are currently taking microbiology. fucking. hell. i don't want to go on too much of a rant here, but essentially, our professor is not a very nice person. when hurricane sandy came rolling through, given that we had missed at least a week and a half of school, most professors took this into consideration and removed certain assignments that were due considering time constraints. not this bitch. in fact, she added onto the syllabus. in the end, we had a little more than 400 pts due in the last week of class in an 800pt course. i have never been so stressed in my entire college career and i think my roommate is about to lose it. 

our freezer is empty. we run to the caf when we can (considering its not closed because our school sucks sometimes), but it has been the same food since the beginning of the semester, and quite frankly, makes me piss out of my asshole. with our final in the class coming up this tuesday, it would really be an unbelievably generous treat to have some pizza to help us study for this test.

tl;dr poor, frustrated bio majors looking for some brain food.
[] my hours got cut unexpectedly and all of my food money is now rent money (santa cruz, ca).. the kids i watch got signed up for summer camp last minute, so all of my working hours are gone. i'm waiting at home now for a few phone calls about jobs, but it's not looking great for being able to eat much more than rice and beans or pasta until the 15th, so a pizza sounds super fantastic, especially after seeing [this](http://redd.it/1fc8e4). it's my first post here, sorry if anything is amiss, thanks for reading! 

[] having kind of a bad day, pizza would really help - phoenix, az. i'm kind of having a terrible day. basically, last night i went out, got drunk, and drunk texted an ex-boyfriend that i had just recently become friends with. he told my best friend, who basically told me that he was uncomfortable and i need to leave him alone. obvious pro-tip: don't keep your phone nearby if you're drunk. 

anyway, i'm an idiot and i feel like crap and i'm a little low on cash because i have to move apartments in the middle of next month, so i have to put down rent on both places. it means a lot of nights playing fable and eating fruit cocktail. a pizza would really help me get through the day. i've given before - and i hate asking - but i would be so, so grateful if i could get one.

[]vancouver, bc, canada father of 5, wife just got out of surgery, we were suddenly cut off from employment insurance.. the government screwed up and now we have to wait over a month for them to refile and reestablish my claim.  there is no way to expedite this at all, in spite of the fact that it is their mistake.  we have 2 girls (9 and 7) and 3 boys (5,3, 2months).

my wife had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital last week for emergency gall bladder removal surgery and we are feeling a bit beat on at the moment.  this would be a humungous pick-us-up.

[] random girl in chicago would love a random act of pizza and to pay it forward. i'm in the hyde park area and would love some pizza, and would especially love seeing some more "random" acts dished out!  if pizza'ed, i promise, in the nature of being similarly random and kind, of gifting a a pizza tomorrow evening to another random requesting individual who intends to pay it forward the next day.  want to join me in breathing more random life into this sub?  let's make some human connections that don't end with the next person.

additionally, if this works, i think we could generate a lot more interest, and a lot more giving, by earmarking a pay-it-forward trend as [pif] included in the title.  more activity in general means more pizza for everyone, including [pif]s and those who could really just use a pizza and are unsure if they can return the gift in the near future.  here's to the random and flourishing future of raop!

[] i spent 3 hours trying to make beercan chicken and ruined it. i got a new smoker a few weeks ago, and decided i wanted to make beercan chicken for the first time.  i had never used a smoker before, but i had smoked food in normal grills.  anyway, walmart only had mesquite and hickory wood chips, which turns out are both terrible.  i couldn't get the smoker to the proper temp, and the smoke "flavor" is one of the worst things i have ever tasted.  needless to say i wont ever be doing that again.  if you could help out by sending a pizza so i don't have to go to bed on an empty stomach, i would really appreciate it!

[] humbly ing a pizza. details included.. fufilled. thanks for reading.

hi there. i'm a 22 year old male who has recently moved. since moving, i've lost a friend, been mugged at gunpoint, had to replace an alternator, and now i have to replace the struts my car. in fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons i'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic i hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. he even has the parts that i paid for sitting on his property. i simply don't have the know how to do so, or i'd do it myself.

as far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. i was to stay with her for a few weeks while i found another place. she told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that i was acting like a child, ect. i wasn't even there half of the time, so i honestly do not know why she went so crazy. it kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.

in any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. i can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too. i'm lucky enough to work really close to where i live, so there is limited strain on the car in its [current state](http://i.imgur.com/z5sdp.jpg). (the strut has recently fallen completely off.) i simply request a pizza. thanks for reading. i appreciate anything you can offer.

[] broke college student who just became a lot more broke. basically, a year ago i bought a computer using a credit card offered with a 0% introductory apr for a year. buried in the fine print was a line explaining that i would be charged 22.9% interest on my initial purchase if i didn't pay in full after 12 months. i didn't realize that bit until yesterday, the one-year anniversary of my purchase (i posted a whole thread about the episode elsewhere). the result - a surprise $500 charge to my card.

and of course all of this happened when my payment plan failed as a result of my financial aid being literally obliterated this year. the state decided to take my grant offers away.

so that was just really rough. i feel awful and scared and screwed and i have no idea how i'm going to to get out of this debt any time soon. doesn't help that i was planning to go to grad school next year. no idea how that will work out now.

so i'd like some pizza to dull the pain. it would literally mean an absolute ton to me right now. thank you for reading this.

() not home 4 the holidays &amp; would really like some pizza for my family!!!. it took a lot of courage to make this post, and it's very had for me being a husband and dad to ask this, but my kids would enjoy it.
this will be my first ever christmas away from my family in 17 years of being married.
i took a job out of town because the economy is so bad where we live. i send home what i can for family. i rent a room so what i send my family is enough to pay the bills. it leaves no room for luxuries like pizza. my family would love a special treat and i would so appreciate it if someone can provide them with a pizza. i am in atlanta, ga. they are in southern fl. 

edit: i am actually in kennesaw, ga. which is a suburb of atlanta. and my family is in homestead, fl.

[] uk university student who hasn't eaten for 5 days, still waiting on student finance.... it's been a while actually, i almost have gotten over food until i found a packet of walkers crisps the other day, not my flavour but i wasn't complaining at all. it only made it worse frankly and i wish i had rationed them. no more money left right now.

student finance have been fucking me around and so far the only substance that is going into me is water and tea (with sugar and milk)

i would happily repay this favor to the kind individual in the coming future when i have received my student finance loan.

right now i'm running out of options in terms of food.

[] college student seeking pepperoni pizza. georgia, usa.. 
() dublin, ireland. watching cartoons while eating pizza...would make me soooo happy !. so... this is finals week, and i figured a responsible way of bracing myself for exams would be......catching up on futurama/adventure time/fullmetal alchemist episodes while eating pizza !! isn't it an awesome idea ? 
also my battleplan involves a blanket and tea, and extreme denial of the imminence of exams ;) 

the only erm, slight problem i encountered in my genius project. is that i'm kinda broke, and fishfingers and cereals only last you so long before you are too broke to have pizza but too proud/ashamed to beg your family to send you enough to last the month :/ anyone ever experienced this ?

so if anyone feels like sending a bit of cheesy food to dublin, ireland, it would really brighten up the whole *week* :d of a broke but happy female economics and politics college student. (not sure if there's a rule to specify stuff about myself to prove i'm real but, yeah, here ou go haha)

if infos are needed or something to prove i'm real pm me please, also i'm not sure how to give my adress or...(?) (sorry about the awkwardness, it's my first time creating a topic instead of just commenting. stomach made me do it)

my dog odie is also out of food now, today i fed him some leftover eggs and hashbrowns with gravy, he will also be enjoying the pizza and i will post pictures of this.

my request is for www.screaminmimispizza.com specifically, because it's only a couple dollars more than a regular chain pizza and it will feed me for 2-3 days. my favorite is a pizza w/ eggplant or the bbq chicken pizza w/ ricotta.

()pizza for sick father-in-law and a couple. . i'm hiding behind this throwaway account because i am embarrassed to ask for help again. we've received pizza before when we were homeless a couple months back. however we moved recently in our new apartment and were already late on rent so all our money went towards bills. my father is lending us gas money tomorrow to get to the food pantry but today i'm not sure what we are going to do. 

my husbands father is staying a couple weeks with us because he wasn't getting the proper care where he lives at. he has heart problems and is diabetic, and he has to eat which makes me feel terrible because we had to pay a more big of a late fee then i thought and i feel that we are letting him down by us as well not giving him the proper care he needs.   

we have no children so i can understand if we aren't helped.

however, if someone does help, i can give them my real account name, and i wouldn't mind taking a picture as well, whatever works.

thanks.

[] i programmed through dinner hours--oops!  help a hungry comp sci student out!. so here's the deal:  i didn't know my college had shortened dinner hours on sunday (only been here a week!) and was so busy catching up on work for my comp sci class that i missed eating.  every place to eat on campus is closed early and i'm on a campus just far enough from town to make walking for food slightly dangerous.  i'm going to be up late programming and i'm starting to get really, really hungry...

[} family of 6 in the inland empire-california. hi thanks for reading our post.  we are a "combined" family of 6 in hemet.  my husband has 3 children ages 15, 11, and 8. i have my 14 year old son.  we are raising the 4 of them without any help (physical, mental or financial) from the other parents.  we have had to close down our small business this year due to the economy and for the first time have had to go on public assistance.  we are struggling to find gainful employment for my husband, but so far have had no luck.  i would be willing to go back to work immediately, however i will be having lung surgery in the near future to find out if i have cancer.  it seems like with the summer here we should be having some kind of fun with our kiddos, but we are not able to afford to take them anywhere so we have made "movie" night and "game" night at home......a pizza would make it a wonderful night....a much needed wonderful night.  thank you for reading.

[] unemployed w/sick dog &amp; huge vet bills - phoenix, az area. i have been unemployed for about six months and recently my dog has had numerous health issues that have led to thousands of dollars in vet bills. i have fallen behind on my mortgage in order to help try and save her. she is slowly doing better but still needs daily medications that i am struggling to pay for. i know to many people it may seem crazy to sacrifice so much for a dog, but she really is my baby. i would appreciate a pizza to help give me some comfort during this difficult time, as i have no family near me either. thanks for your consideration.
[] bought someone pizza, now i'm craving it.... so i spent the weekend with a good friend of mine and his room mate. in exchange, i just ordered them a pizza and a couple of 2 liters of mello yellow. being college students, they hadn't had the money to go to a grocery store and their fridge consisted of a carton of eggs and a pitcher of koolaid. i felt like they needed it. anywho, my problem now is that now that i've bought someone else pizza, i really want some. it's just me so a small one would do fine and i have plenty of drinks in my dorm. i'd be ever grateful. &lt;3

[] i have been having shit luck... pizza will help morale!. [request] out of saint louis missouri. (specifically the soulard area)

so here is my story, hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..

for the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery.
at one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. talked to my family and got help. i was addicted to amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. i spend 42 days in rehab.. came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. i got the best job i have ever had (contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south saint louis market contractor. (basically i managed all southern saint louis contractors)
things were going great, with my new job i rented out a new apartment set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. then one day, when i was heading back from a narcotics anonymous meeting, i got pulled over in illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in saint louis) the police officer informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in o-fallon missouri for possession of a controlled substance. you see, i knew that this warrant was a possibility, but i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (before rehab) i had been arrested for possesion and they had let me go, with no ticket, not even a court date. since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.
well. long story short(er) i ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville illinois, 2 days in madison county, and 1 day in st charles county. my mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.

she had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, we would be able to preserve my job. well, no luck. i lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.

so here i am. 1 month later. with barely any food in my fridge, a carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. i have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house.
but i am still sober! which i am proud of, months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong.
so i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to make my evening tonight. i would love to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.

i can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: graduation certificates, an empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of..
thanks in advance.

tldr; living life like a boss, then old warrant came up, lost everything because of bad decisions in the past.. pizza will help morale.
[] just found out about this community from another post. not in need, just trying it out!. i found this community through [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iphuy/during_an_illness_a_friend_recommended_reddit_to/) and thought it sounded pretty ludicrous, so i figured i would check it out. i pop in, read through the sidebar and notice this tidbit:

"requestors, please be completely honest about your circumstances. we don’t mind multiple requestors or asking for pizza just for fun or asking for any reason."

darn interesting, i figured that the community here would be completely against people who are not starving and out of cash requesting pizza, but i absolutely fucking love pizza, so here i am testing it out

again, being completely upfront, i am not in any ridiculous need for pizza, besides my undying love for it. i pay my bills every month, i have a decent lump of money saved up in the bank, all is going pretty well, but here is the request anyways!

oh almost forgot, here is my verification code: zkmsfefyft6b

hopefully thank you
[ - lower mainland bc] feeling pretty under the weather this week, would love a nice slice of cheese and pesto to munch on. i've been feeling pretty crummy all weekend.. 8 of my friends left on a trip to japan, and the weather here hasn't been at all great. i just got a job, but i work from home, and now that it's summer, everyone at my house is gone but me. i'm definitely not used to being alone so much. needless to say, it's all brought my mood down.

i've never done anything like this pizza act before, but it would definitely make my week if someone would send over a cheese and pesto pizza or something.
[] i have never eaten pizza before. michigan.. hi reddit, i'm new (but am enjoying this place so far!) so i hope this is still allowed. i'm an ex-amish youth from a strict religious sect in ohio who decided to leave during rumspringa. i have never had the chance to eat pizza or most other foods that are not home made until recently, but now i am in college and can do what i please. 

i am pretty money-less at the moment and would love to be able to eat a pizza, and share it with my roommate. i am in michigan, in the usa. i can post pictures of my first pizza eating experience if someone decides to help. or if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me. thank you reddit! 

edit: still no pizza :(! welcoming questions, though!
[] no money andi just want a pizza. [central ohio]. i'm really hungry and i just want a pizza. i've been craving one over the past few days and i want a pizza. papa john's or some local pizza is preferred. thanks in advance. edit: my friend can also draw you a cartoonish picture of your choice, if you'd like.
[] my debit card was frozen due to detected fraud, today is a bank holiday in the us, so i cannot pull money out in person. will pay it forward as soon as my new card arrives. . pretty straight forward, i'm not a struggling individual, however i have been inconvenienced by someone's criminal theft of my card information on a holiday weekend. 
[] [uk] basically, i recently moved into my new flat for university and.... ...i've spent my weekly allowance on other necessities like bed sheets, toilet paper, etc. i had enough money left over to have food the day before yesterday. i didn't mind not eating yesterday since i was asleep due to the exhaustion from moving. 

i daren't ask my parents for money because i know money is very tight and being the over loving parents that they are, they'd stop eating for a week if it means i'm comfortable and i just cannot do that to them. if anyone is willing to send me a pizza, then great. if not, then thanks for actually reading all this :)

i'm in bristol btw

thanks
[] got overzealous paying off the car last week, have $1.36 until may 15. but the car no longer belongs to the bank! . thanks for getting this far. 

not to pile on the bad news, because it really isn't that bad, but i just got a call from the landlord that the power's been out for a few hours in my complex, and to be careful of the food in the fridge when i get back from work. 

sounds like it could be a long monday.

[] out of money college student. hello raop,


i don't usually beg for stuff, but i don't have anything to eat today. i've spent all of my dining hall meals this week since i was busy studying and ate an easy three meals a day. it payed off though because i got an a in two classes. gah, i'm rambling. the only thing edible i have in my room is coffee. i like coffee. anyway, why not give this a shot.

[] arizona. red light ticket, whoops there goes all my extra money. well the ticket is imo total bs (it looks like i come to a full stop to me in the little grainy video) but i have to pay it, according to the ticket i did not come to a complete stop while making a right on red. pretty crappy mood about it and was poor before having to pay it. pizza is my comfort food. also there's that email from pj's that says if i order more than $10 i'll get 25 papa points, that would make this week not so shitty. i thank anyone for considering my request.
[] vet bill after dog attacked by pair of pit broke the bank. would really enjoy pizza after a stressful day.. so i've never posted in raop before but a friend suggested i come here. yesterday a pair of pits attacked me and my dog while walking around my neighborhood and i just paid off the vet and hospital bills this morning. it really has left me with $6.88 and means i have no money to eat for a week. i'm going to try and find a way to get food for the meantime (food pantry perhaps?) but after the stress a pizza would be amazing.

if you are willing to help me make it through this week with offers of pizza until i get paid, every single pizza will be paid forward after pay day.

{} wrecked my car last weekend while up north, spent the last of my money paying a deposit for a rental car.  eating toast two days in a row is getting old...  in west michigan. . all i have at home is a loaf of bread, since i was on vacation when the accident happened (as typical in michigan, a deer decided to do a few cartwheels over the two-week old car).  luckily insurance is covering the car, but since i don't have a credit/debit card, i had to pay the deposit in cash, depleting all my money until friday when i get paid again. to make matters worse, the rental car they gave me is a baby blue nissan versa, which is embarrassing as hell to drive.

i am in grand haven, mi and was wondering if there was any way i could get just a basic pepperoni pizza.  the only chain places are jets, pizza hut, and dominoes (and dominoes last i knew used one of those carbon copy things the driver carried for the cc since they demand the person with the card to be here).

i will pay it forward after i get paid on friday.  i am just slightly sick of having toast and butter the past two days...

[] want to do something nice for my sister and brother in law.. :). well, here is the sob story.

i just moved in with my sister and brother in law.. they bought a new house and need a roommate, and knowing that i am just out of college and looking for work and all that.. they got me to do it. :p

the first week i moved down here, the small amount of money that i had to get through to find a job was frozen in my bank account because bank of america is such a pos. i was literally down here a week, and without any notice/phone call/email.. etc. they froze my account and reissued my debit card back to my parents house where i was living (a days trip away, in another state). i was there planning to cancel my account, when they told me i was going to be unable to do so without my new card... that was a couple of days away in the mail. so basically i am broke as shit. :/

i just started my new job down here, but they pay bi-weekly. i just received my first check, but it immediately had to go to the new bank that i have for student loans and car insurance, to avoid late payments. so for the next two weeks i am broke and even have to bum gas money off of my sister to get to work until i am paid, and she cant really afford to be helping me as much as she is already.

i'd really like to do something nice for her in the meantime... so, anyone want to give me a hand?

sorry for the wall of text... and not really sure of what else to do, just found this awesome subreddit :)
[] it's my 29th bday and i'm low on funds and not even going out tonight in little rock. not even sure how this works, kind of feels weird just asking for someone i don't know to give me something, but... this does exists... so something vegetarian would be awesome.

[] broke and hungry in oakland, ca. i'm out of food stamps till the 6th, and i've been eating fruits and vegetables salvaged from dumpsters behind high end grocery store in berkley. while pizza probably isn't the healthiest source of it, the lack of protein i'm getting from my current diet is making me rather weak, and to be honest, i'm getting rather burnt out of potatoes, carrots, and apples. a pizza would be absolutely killer right now. please help a girl out, i promise i'll return the favor to someone else in need once i'm less down on my luck.

edit: a friend of mine just came over with a few groceries for me, so i no longer need a pizza, but if you're still willing to give me one, i'll happily take it.
[] nl, canada, help us celebrate!. today my boyfriend and i have been together 7 years. it's been a rough, jobless summer, and although we are both back to work, we don't get paid until thursday. we have no money for food, or to celebrate our anniversary. a pizza would make us so happy!

the only place that has online ordering right now only accepts credit cards, so we know it might be a long shot, but hoping someone would be kind enough to help us out. :)
() just bailed a friend out of jail. i just bailed a childhood friend out of jail today. he had been getting mixed up in drugs, and honestly, i hadn't spoken to him in about a year. but i never stopped caring about him. he got pulled over, and cops found a bag of weed. he got arrested and no one else, even his family, came to get him out. cost me around $1000 to release him... im dry with money now and could use a a pizza... i of course would pass along the generosity 
[] surrey uk so hungry...bank won't give me money.... so, here is the story, it starts on thursday 22nd february 2012. i have had a hectic month and have all but run out of money, by the time i realised i wasn't getting paid till the 1st i had maybe 3 or 4 pounds left in my account. now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza. 


but with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st. so for one week i lived on the 11p noodles at tescos, 3 meals a day of 11p noodles, with the promise of a pizza on the 1st though, my mind was battling through. 28th of feb and low and behold it is a leap year this year....ok i say, that's fine, one more day, few more noodles i can deal,  i've come this far already. 


the first hits, and the thought of my pizza is incredible, my mouth is watering at the idea as i get out of bed. and the first thing i do is go to check my balance and pay my rent....oh what's that? yes. my bank details were stolen? virus on my computer? now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( but tomorrow i tell myself. tomorrow.


i head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza. well i forgot about that. and manage to fall asleep at about 5am that night waking up for bank closing on saturday. great. tomorrow is sunday. no pizza then either, and if my card doesn't arrive tomorrow i may have to wait even longer for my pizza. so i call out to you. to all you pizza samaritans. help me. in my hour of need, i call upon you reddit.
[] hungry in washington :). i would be so eternally grateful if someone would like to order me a pizza! i can provide verification--i am flat ass broke until friday. been on a ramen diet for a few days now. on friday, regardless of whether i get a pizza tonight or not, i will purchase two pizzas for two different people. 
[] hungry student in toronto! could use a pizza for the midterms!. a university student cramming for exams, spend all my money on coffee and energy drinks to keep myself going! could really use a pizza! thanks in advance for everything! can give proof of verification!
[] hungry, out of money and did i mention i love pizza? (usa). so first of all, this account is a throwaway. truth be told, i'm embarrassed i'm at this point again, and also, my good friends have my actual account info and i'd just rather them not know i'm here. i have received pizza here once before. my first reddit cakeday was in august. i'm more than willing to link someone to my real account and provide some sort of proof that i am who i say i am. i just don't want everyone to know! though i am willing to give thanks from my real account. it's a different feeling, afterwards.

okay if you made it past that, the short story is that i'm, like most, out of money. i get paid on friday but until then i'm scavenging. i'm a kind hearted person but i know there are tons of people deserving of food! i'm just hoping someone takes pity on me. pretty please! i'd be so grateful.

tl:dr - pizza?

edit: i live in washington state.
[][trade] domino's pizza for my olive garden gift card. we are completely out of food and have no way of getting anything or any money at the moment and all i have to offer is an olive garden gift card. it has $25 on it and i will never use it as we don't live close to one. if anyone can help us out, i will gladly send you my card and i will even send you the info or a picture so you can check the balance on it yourself :) we live right next to domino's so a ecard for them would be absolutely perfect as we can walk right there and pick it up.

[] ct, usa - hungry college student on summer break. hey guys; i've been out of school for about 2 weeks now, and my noodle supply has been running low this week. i haven't gotten any calls back for employment yet, but i'm hoping/gonna keep trying. a pizza would be awesome for the next couple days.

request has been filled

[] hey guys, i hate to ask but i'm in a tough spot. i recently graduated from college, moved to a new city then had my bank account hacked by some motherfucker in england. i have literally no money and i don't know what to do. i owe a bunch but i have nothing. i'm looking for a job and i was expecting to find something more than minimum wage after getting a ba but lo and behold that has not happened. anyways, i'm hungry and cold and homeless. i'm couch surfing and i'd love some food. here's the difficult part, i'm vegan. i hate to be a beggar and a chooser, but i'd prefer a vegan pizza. the upshot of that is that i'm around berkeley, california. that said, i'm willing to take whatever, i'm getting hungry enough that my morals are fading. pm me if you're willing to help. thanks!
: i just found this while browsing reddit and i'm in the mood for some pizza today. i'm sick of my noodles right now and pizza sounds awesome. . idk what to write here.

[] there's a 3700+ acre fire going on in my town. would any of you be willing to help me send pizza to the firefighters?. hi, information about the fire [here.](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/morgan-fire-near-mt-diablo-chars-1500-acres-222950261.html)

i'll be stopping by the fire station myself later tonight and will be bringing homemade dishes... i'm thinking probably a few large casseroles or something easy to make in bulk. the thought crossed my mind that this seems like the sort of thing reddit would love to help with. 

pizza donations can be sent to the confire station #11 at 6500 center st. in clayton, ca. the firefighters have been working all day and night since the fire broke out yesterday, and i'm sure they'd appreciate some hot, cheesy slices of pizza! 

to help you out, [here](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=pizza&amp;find_loc=6500+center+st.%2c+clayton%2c+ca&amp;ns=1&amp;ls=883fdc931eaafb15) is the yelp page for pizza places near the address. 

hoping to be able to send at least 4-5 pizzas over there for dinner tonight. let's make this happen! :)

 snellville georgia. it took me some time to figure out where to make this post. my friend mary has received pizza from here, and told me this is where i should post. i worked with her husband at a distribution center that has closed down, and i am at the point between choosing buying medicine and buying food. i was diagnosed with chf congestive heart failure and underwent triple bypass surgery last year. going without my medication is not an option and i'm willing to provide pictures of my empty and nearly empty pill bottles. my son is going to help me with food when he gets paid on the 17th, but i really can't go another night without eating.

i'm a uk postgraduate student who's been putting in long hours into her phd and is getting a mighty craving for a pizza. unfortunately, i only get paid every four months, and i'm at the end of a pay period so money is very tight.

as my payday is monday, i intend to pay it forward and send some hungry redditor a pie once the money hits my account.

additionally, if you feed me, i'll send you a picture of my very cute pet rabbit, being cute. deal?

thank you very much!

[] finally moved out! (up-upstate ny). hello, reddit! long-time lurker, first time poster on reddit!

so at the ripe age of 22, i have finally moved out of my mom's house, and into an apartment with a friend of mine. rent's been paid, bills are paid, hell, i even just got a job! unfortunately, all our money has been spent on the aforementioned things, and we're down to rice and ramen in the cupboards until my first paycheck. (she's still trying to find a job). so i came here to petition for a pizza in celebration of our new apartment, new jobs, and hopefully a fresh start! 

in return for a pizza, i would be returning a pizza on the day of my first paycheck (the 27th) to whoever is so kind as to get us one tonight. hell, i'll give one away either way. i am also not above taking funny pictures with the pizza, attempting some sort of art involving the pizza, or pretty much anything else silly that one might request in return for some of that delicious, cheesy-goodness! 

thanks for considering me, and i hope you all have a grand evening!

(thinking back on everything, i probably should have waited till i was in my college dorm later this year).


anyway, i've been staying in an extra room at a friends house. they're gone for a week and i thought at least try here. a pizza can hold me over for a few days till i can get my small part time job pay check.

[] (amherst, ma)3 hungry bicycle mechanics! . the three of us live in a tiny house (dubbed: the hobbit hole) and all are bicycle mechanics in the area. obviously, it is not the most profitable of seasons for us- although i have taken on a job working the door at a local bar (as has another of my roomates), as well as an after school assistant in a town nearby. but paychecks are two weeks away, and will finally make life easy again! two of us are finishing getting our degrees. 

it's been a long day, and we just managed to scrape rent together, but don't really have a great amount of food in the house (save some rice, eggs and oatmeal, that we need to save for the rest of the week and until our next paychecks) 

we just really want to enjoy a pizza together on a sunday night!

[] student in need of pizza, from berkshire, uk.. hey! my mother's awol, and i have no money; the oven's broken, and i'm feeling pretty depressed. i don't want to have to eat a bread-and-butter sandwich for dinner again tonight, and i'd really like a random act of pizza.

would anyone feel kind enough to buy me a pizza/give me a gift card/code? as stated in the title, i'm in the united kingdom.

even if not,

i love you, reddit. every single one of you.
[] my dorm is on lockdown, and i'm going stir crazy! nova. stuck at umw where we're currently on lockdown because of irene, and irene isn't even all that awful here! i've been listening to my roommate sing showtunes for the past four hours. life is hard.

[] las cruces, nm -- will write for pie. hiya, i apologize for not really being a part of the reddit community, but i browse from time to time. please don't hold it against me. anyways, here's the deal. it's saturday, i have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now. 

by trade, i am a freelance writer. sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. but i understand the give-and-take of economy and i'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. so i'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. haiku about thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, i can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as i can fit on the page. and none of that copy-paste bull crap either, i promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.

maybe you want more than one page. these things happen. and i happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. or i might want mushrooms and pepperoni. we can work it out.

just about the only thing i won't write is a signed confession that i was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. let them figure it out on their own.

if you order a pizza for me, i promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming i have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15). can provide photo proof of brown sky, flat tire on bike, or other reasonable requests if needed. will gladly provide gratuitous photo proof of pizza enjoyment if desired.

thanks raop!

(i thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  after waiting a few days, i realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. so i decided to start asking those who i knew would do anything for me.. or so i thought.. immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, i had to move on to my good friends.. my best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn't an option.. my other best friend and neighbor would definitely take me in.. i just knew she would!!  she has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. so i asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. without even pretending to think about it.. she said "i don't have any room for you".. that was it.. i had exhausted all my options.. one day before my eviction i started to plan the best way to be homeless.. i decided to live in my van.... scary doesn't come close to how i felt, but my fear was deep.... ring ring! it's curtis.. a friend i met thru my best friend.. i knew him and considered him a friend but we didn't know each other very well.. without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  i burst into tears.. i was relieved.. but mostly, i was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as i am!  so here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat tonight.. let alone tomorrow.. but it's 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. i want curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!  thanks for reading! :)
[] i lost my job 1 month ago but start 2 new ones next week. now i'm starting to run out of food.. hello, i was thrown through some hoops at my old job, which resulted in me not working for a whole month (without any heads up that i would not be working). i was smart with what money i had left and paid my next months rent and groceries. i am starting to run out of food now and will not be able to purchase any for another week. if anyone would be kind enough to brighten my day with a pizza, i would greatly appreciate it and pass on the good deed once i get back on my feet.
[] funding for university is taking too long.. recently i have started back at university for year 2 and my funding application hasn't been processed yet. i have been volunteering with my local charity and although the work is good and i'm getting experience and references and all that, i'm not earning any money. my application probably won't be processed for another two weeks and until it is i'll have no money, and most importantly, no pizza.
[] toronto, canada. would totally love to have some pizza to eat.. hey guys. this is the first time ive ever posted here. this is my throwaway though and not my actual reddit account.

anyway i was wondering if someone could hook me up with a pizza? im 21 years old and on government assistance (i live on my own and go to school). ive been having a kind of shitty week. it would be pretty cool to have something to eat, as it'll be a couple days before i'll have money.

thanks.
[] - i'm not "poor", i haven't only been eating toast for a month, but i did lose my job and can't afford to buy pizza. i'm just being 100% honest here. i'm not starving, but due to me losing my job and only having enough money to pay bills for 2 months if i don't buy anything, i haven't had pizza in a very long time. i actually moved here from out of state because the job market is better. i am currently living with my parents, at the age of 32. :(
() northside ohio anyone out there to help?. pregnant with twins and have 3 other lil ones. fridge went out and landlord wont be able to replace till tuesday. so anything would be a blessing to me and my family right now. thanks and god bless all!
 ~ would love to have a pizza to enjoy with our family .. we have our son who came to visit and we are so embarrassed as we didnt know and dont have much to pick from. we live on a limited amount of food a week for a family of 3 . so we are asking for a pizza for 4 . we would really enjoy it and would love to sit like old times with our son and talk . i am the only one working as my wife has lupus and cant work anymore. so living on one pay check is very hard . there is nothing left for a yummy cheese pizza . we havent had a good pizza from papa johns in ages ! we would really enjoy it for sundays dinner . thank you 
// even united way couldn't help me!. i haven't worked in weeks and unemployment is taking forever to go through. i ran out of stuff to sell, owe 2 different friends a lot of money, and am in desperate need of food. i rode a bus and walked the rest of the way to a local food bank, they said i needed an appointment. called to make one, they aren't taking appointments right now, wtf.

so a little while ago i dialed 211 and tried the united way, they helped my mom a lot when i was little. she got abuse counseling, food, clothes, utilities, everything practically free from them. i told them straight up, i ain't got a car, their exact words were none of my local banks deliver, thanks for calling, click. i called back three times and every time they keep sending me to the same place that already told me no.

reddit you're my last hope. i saw the story a few months back, didn't need it then but i need it now. when united way gives you the shaft you know it's bad. if i gotta walk five miles to get it i'll do it, i don't need the exercise but i need food. i feel like i've been walking the desert for a minute and ten hours. hope there's some love flowing through here today for me. peace. 

forgot to mention i'm in jacksonville, florida.
[] i kinda dun goofed. so. not gonna lie. i've put myself in a bad spot through a combination of bad planning bad, decision-making, and bad luck. im out of food and currently unemployed. a pizza would be nice instead of ramen. you know how it is, bland food for so long and your just aching for something with flavor. helps keep me from going nuts. my cash is going straight to my rent payment that im really late on. hopefully temp assitance doesn't drag their feet much longer.   also. selling a bunch of stuff to pay bills. comment if interested. will provide pics and stuff.

[] pizza in boston. i'm as broke as i've ever been and hungry. i'm typically the kind of person who tries to help others so i'm pretty sure i'll pay it forward the first chance i get.

*laid off, foreclosed, evicted but still optimistic.
[] edinburgh, scotland. will record song of your choice on acoustic guitar + vocals!. low on cash, only have my guitar and my wits. request any song and i'll try and learn it and record it for you! don't mind where the pizza comes from but, being a vegan, it can't have cheese or meat on it. still counts as pizza. i think.
help me repay the most important person in my life! []. my extremely supportive boyfriend has allowed me to follow my dream, and supports the both of us with his salary. i have a vintage store on etsy, and within the last year i've found it's truly my passion.

without a doubt, my boyfriend is one of the most kindhearted and caring people i've ever had the honor of knowing. he gives me support and tells me that my happiness is worth us counting pennies. he allowed me to search for, and find my passion.

we live a life without credit card debt, and choose to pay with things upfront in our daily lives. we pay our bills, but do not have any spending money. we spend every penny simply on our necessities, so much so that we've only been on two real dates in our 10 months of being a couple. 

i would really appreciate any kindness to repay him with a warm and toasty pizza! i can easily verify who i am, and would greatly appreciate and kindness from reddit!

thank you and have a great weekend everyone!

[] miami. hello, /r/, i am a 19 year old male in sunny miami who is in a situation that's anything but sunny. i recently lost my job (august 15th was my last day), and i've been living with my mother since the job hunt is not going well. my mom is a 55 year-old who cleans houses for a living, barely able to scrap together the $915 rent, as well as the $220 light bill, $90 cable and internet bill, and our $110 cell phone bill. 

when i had a job, i'd pay for half of everything. rent, cable, light, and cell phone. we had plenty to eat, and i'd take her out for dinner, and even pay her day's work so she'd have a day to rest.

now, she pays for everything, and sometimes she works 2-3 jobs every day. i keep going to job interviews, but to no avail. we have no food. we go shopping once a month, but how much can $80 in food last you?

i'm hungry, /r/, i ate my first bit of food for the first time in 2 days today, and it was horrible. 
i long for some good food, and i long for the kindness of strangers.

[] starving artist in astoria, queens (nyc) could really use a pizza from the nearest domino's to help with pms right about now... :(. hiya, this is for my friend, not me. she's a freelance makeup artist juggling several part-time gigs and school and she's been having a hard time making ends meet lately. she had an especially shitty day today and i'd love to send her a pizza to cheer her up, but i'm currently unemployed (yay) so i thought maybe reddit could help me.

[] have been depressed lately with the lack of job.. i'm a decently skilled desktop support/network tech and just haven't had any luck. i've resorted to trying to get my old magazine sales/retention job back.

[] a pizza for a fellow canadian in need . i have been suffering from pretty bad depression and social anxiety over the past 6 months. ended up dropping out of my last semester of university and quit my job during this time. i just maxed out my credit card on a new prescription, and i am out of even credit now. the bottom line is i have no money to buy any food right now and only have a few cans of beans left. i would love to have a nice hot pizza to get me through the next few days. i am hoping this newest prescription works how it should and i am able to get out and find a job because i would love to play it forward and help out a fellow redditor in need. i verified my email and also have another account which has a bunch of karma, i just have a few friends on that account and would be too embarrassed for them to find out about my current situation. thanks in advance for anyone that has taken the time to read this and hope someone can help out. 

some of the local pizza places are pizza pizza, ginos pizza, pizza hut, domino's pizza. pizza pizza being the closest. 
[] nanaimo, canada - my parents have had the week from hell and could really use a pizza.. hey guys,

my parents have had a terrible week, and while i would normally buy them dinner at a time like this i'm between paycheques and out of cash.

this week my dad lost his job of 12 years, on top of that yesterday our family dog passed away (14 years old, so not totally unexpected). they are just really in the "world against us" point of view. they could really use some love from the world at large, and that is where i was hoping roap might come in.

if you guys could find a way to send them some saucy cheesy goodness that would be amazing, and come next friday (payday) i will be passing it on.

thanks guys!
() anyone able to help out a college girl down on her luck. roll tide roll. after reading some of these posts, it really warms my heart to know there are such great people out there in the world. figured i'd throw my request out there and see what happens.

i just finished up my junior year at the university of alabama, i'm double majoring in marketing and finance, so i've had to take out a whole lump of loans to pay for everything. my mom and dad help out as much as they can, but i'm the youngest of 4 and they are tapped out at this point.

i'm working as a summer intern at a local law firm, but of course they don't have to pay me anything, so i'm essentially an indentured servant to them :(

but i'll scrape by, i always have, and always will, but if anyone had it in their heart and could manage it, i would love a pizza over the weekend. i've got some girlfriends coming over, and for some reason a wine and pizza night sounds pretty great right now.

roll tide

[] california, usa - looking to eat some pizza with my homework. hey guys,

if someone could hook it up with a pizza while i do some homework that would be awesome.  i'm low on cash cuz i had to buy some school supplies.  i'll be able to get some next week and i will give a pizza out in return.

thanks
[] just found out about random acts of pizza. im single father raising 2 kids and im unemployed but looking. so far our current plan for tonight is cereal again.. 
[] college student living alone, no car, no money 'til the 3rd.. before i begin with why i'd like a pizza, i just want to say that all of you are wonderful human beings for the generosity you show. from the bottom of my heart, thank you. this isn't a sob story, i hope it doesn't come off that way. i understand life gets people down sometimes and mine has been especially hard to me lately. i'm just trying to explain my situation.

i recently got released from the hospital due to a bad bout of pneumonia. my insurance company wanted a deposit of 300 dollars. i'm a student and have my own apartment and support myself completely on my own, so this was a huge hit to me. i also just paid rent, my phone bill, internet bill, and some of my tuition for this coming semester, and barely scraped by, even though i had been saving all of my money other than that and some groceries.

i'm currently unemployed as well. i had a bicycle but i had to sell it in order to pay my deposit. my disability check does not come until the 3rd of july and i currently have 20 dollars in cash on me to last until then.
i'm going to go buy some ramen noodles and soup mix once it cools down outside. my lungs are bad and it's stressful for me to walk in this kind of heat.

if anyone would like to donate a pizza to me, it would feed me for 3 or 4 days (i'm not a big eater). i only ever eat pizza when my friends have it, so it would not only feed me, but be a real treat for me as well! 
i just have to tell you i am allergic to any kind of mushrooms. anything other than that, i'm not picky at all.

thank you so much for reading this, and i hope that soon i am in the position to donate a pizza to somebody else.
[] boone, nc. recent graduate turned townie. just started part time job, but paycheck is a week away.. haven't found a real job. just graduated from appalachian state university with a double major in risk management &amp; insurance and economics. been eating ramen noodles for 2 days just ran out. super broke looking for some delicious pizza. favorite toppings are pepperoni and pineapple,but would be pumped for anything.
[] stuck in nowheresville, va. this has been the worst week of my life.

monday, my grandmother died.

tuesday, i spend all day getting affairs in order to go out of town for a few days. important to note that, on this day, i lose my driver's license.


wednesday morning, i'm having trouble finding my passport, and i end up making my ride to the airport late for work.


thursday goes off without a hitch!! luckily!


friday, there's a lot of last minute things to do for the funeral this morning. my mom asks me to take her car to go pick up the dress nana will wear for the funeral. i decide to grab some food while i'm out. when the girl is handing me my food, i drop the bag. awesome. love friday.


today, immediately after the funeral. i get dropped off at the airport (5 hours away) and go to check in, only to realize i've missed my flight by 4 hours. i just checked into a hotel near the airport. 




i'm just asking for something small. my credit card is under so much stress right now, and i really can't afford to put more money on it without breaking my ability to make a payment this month. 


also, my nephew used my cell phone this morning, and logged me out. i have no idea what my account's password is until i can look on the computer tomorrow morning. i'd be happy to provide some other verification though.
[] hungover and broke in brooklyn and would love a pizza. if this works i plan on paying it forward friday.. i'm broke till next friday, but i'm in such a need of a pizza right now!  no sob story here; i have food at my apartment, but i don't think any of it is gonna hit the spot like a nice slice right about now.  and i really want something to help with hangover right now.

if this works i plan on paying forward friday.  if you wanted to determine the criteria for the pizza i give away i would be game for that!
[] moved back home, unemployed 2 months. waiting to see what happens with a great opportunity. but sure could go for some cheese.. so i moved back home to southeastern wi at the start of march when i could not find a new job. as soon as i got home a friend resigned and recommended me for his position. i'm just waiting for them to decide what to do with the position.

in the mean time i sure could go for some cheese. especially tonight. want a sob story? how about this. i bought myself a $6.00 block of cheese last week. made two sandwiches from it and then my dad ate the rest. in one sitting.

[] please sir (miss). might we have a pizza?. hi fellow pizza lovers. i stumbled across this subreddit at work today, and holy wow. this is the best thing i've seen in awhile.
my boyfriend and i are both government workers who just bought a house. a house, you say! why, you are a plethora of good tidings and joy! well, while that is true, we are also supremely poor because of it. we've been saving for a long time to acquire this house, and while it rules, we haven't purchased anything awesome for a long, long time (and will continue on this path until either magic or raises happen. i, personally, have my eyes on magic). spaghetti (cheapest. food. ever. still delicious. how does it happen?) every night and pb &amp; j every afternoon. i'm not complaining. definitely used to it at this point. we just miss pizza! we miss it so!
regardless of the outcome of this request, i still think this is the coolest idea in the world, and hope that many might profit from its supreme and magnanimous awesomeness. oh yeah! we're in pittsburgh, pa
[]my mother and i are starving, could you please help this night be easier on us.. im 27 and still living with my mom. i stay with her to help her through her pain and her work, she doesn't really have anyone else so i feel obligated to be here for now. my paycheck alone is going entirely to bills, medication, gas(which is killing me), other.. the one good thing is that the little money i do manage to save is going to my community college, so i am getting an education with the free time i have.. regardless of all of that, there is nothing in my house to eat right now, and i am starving. could you please help? it would mean the world to me and my mother right now, and it would definitely take care of 1 problem for tonight.

[] heard a story about this site and promptly dropped my jaw. hey! so i'm hoping someone can help this college student from the north shore of massachusetts that just returned home to a family with far greater concerns than sticking pizza down my throat. i'm looking for jobs but no luck, per usual, and i'm hoping someone on here is willing to give me something to put in the win column seeing as it's been a while since i've been able to do so.

my email is 5yardfacemask@gmail.com

thanks for existing everyone that is in this community :)

the current temp is 105. on the upside i got a potential job offer today! it only took about three months, too! :p !!

i would love some pizza tonight to restore some semblance of normalcy to my life... and after a lot of walking today, the idea of turning on the stove top to make rice again seems depressing.

a haiku to commemorate the day:

eggs on car hoods fry  
pavement seems a bit sticky  
worth it, job offer.

[] hungry student in bad situation. i don't want to post from my main, but i've been a redditor for some time now. i live with my boyfriend and roommate, and both are in between jobs right now. i've known my roommate since high school and i know that if i ask them to leave, they will have nowhere else to go. i'd love to have a roommate or boyfriend for that matter that doesn't stress me out and put so much pressure on me when it comes to money. i should actually be saying my money, but i never get to see any of it. my income goes straight to bills and food. 

i am coming to a point where i no longer see both of the people that i live with as just having a hard time. they've been unemployed since february and june, and i've been paying for everything for months. i really can't take it anymore. i can't even put away enough money to take a trip to get away from everything and everyone. between work and school, i am really at my limit.

i'm hoping that another redditor who has been here before in this situation will help me with something other than canned vegetables for dinner (pretty please? :d). i would love a pizza and it would pretty much make my entire year, because this would be the only nice thing i've gotten. if someone is able to help, you would be a hero! i should also mention that i'm in nyc (brooklyn stand up!). 
() a pizza would really be appreciated over here in fairfax, va. today, has been a shitty day, starting out with me falling asleep during an exam and not even answering 25-30 of the 96 questions after studying for most of the night, becoming ill shortly afterwards and missing my crew practice today due to the fact i missed the shuttle between campuses at 12:00 and missed the carpool for my crew team. on said shuttle i took at 1:00, i left my ipod. here i sit hoping someone will contact me saying they have it. so roap'ers can y'all please brighten my day with a pizza?

[] will trade movie cash for dinner. long time reader, first time poster.  forgive me if there's a better place for this, but i thought i'd try here.

i'm a divorced dad with limited funds.  the ex is remarried and in a better financial place.  not trying to compete with her, but i hate always telling the kids we can't go out to eat.  i have $60 in fandango cash that i basically have nothing to do with right now.  the kids and i have seen what we're going to see until the summer, and i figured maybe i could trade it for a gift card somewhere.  as i said, i've followed this site for a long time, but i've always been too proud to ask for help.  this way i figure i'm not taking a handout.  what i'm hoping is to get 2 $25 gift cards, and i would give $30 in movie cash for each one.  if you're not familiar with fandango cash, you can use it at any theater that accepts fandango, and it never expires.  you can look on fandango.com for more info.  

i know there are a lot of great people on here, and i'm hoping some of them would enjoy going to the movies :)

have a great day!

[] [us-va] my sister really needs the help. pizza could mean a meal for my sister her family

my sister recently has had a string of bad happenings, both of our grandmothers just died and her car broke down on the way to the funerals (~500mi)... its been very tough and we recently went over her financial standing and she averages -120 a month (more if you include her hospital bill that she dosn't pay)-- but money aside what she needs most is food especially for her daughter(12) and step daughter(17). thats what she really cares about..

she recently gained full custody of her daughter, the father sat in jail for the first 9 years of his daughter's life.. then upon regaining his freedom sought to take her away to montana, over 2,000 miles away. an ex-con with a new lawyer girlfriend and a seedy past of child abuse with his other offspring.. luckily she won that- but with that came a nice sized loan for her own lawyer

she's been denied by assistance and by the local food bank- she make just over the line for too much

canned goods, cereal, lunch items for school or anything else

i, her younger sister, am a designer (the starving artist) i gave her what i could of my savings to keep her in her apartment, but now i'm reaching out to the web- she has pizza hut and papa johns by her home or  i can trade work for pizza/favors

thank you for your time

[] west palm beach, florida. i just realized i spent my last $20 on a birthday present for my nephew. i'll have lunch provided to me at work tomorrow, but tonight i've go an empty fridge.. my autistic nephew had his 15th birthday yesterday. i bought him some dora the explorer dvds for him.

 on my way home from work i stopped by walmart to grab a frozen pizza but was declined at the register. 

there's a soul food fund raiser at work tomorrow where i can eat, and then i get paid on thursday. however tonight i've got nothing.

i'm requesting just a basic pizza to eat tonight with some slices i can save for breakfast. since i get paid on thursday i can totally pay it forward. it would really help me out guys, and i'd really like to return the favor. 

thanks for taking the time to read this. and my nephew loved the dvds. his sister looks like dora, so he gets very excited when watching them since he cant live with his 'real' family. he's a former student of my sister who took him in from his parents who couldn't take care of him. long story, but i don't mind answering any questions about it.

[] not a sob story, just really hungry.. i just moved to new york city and started my new job. i get paid my very first check on friday but i currently have no money in my bank account, so i'm not sure what to do until then. figured i would try this out. cool idea regardless, i can't wait to pay it forward!  

[]  i haven't eaten anything besides salad dressing in 2 days.. [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ckvge)

i never thought i would be in this position, i usually tough out times like these when money is scarce and survive on ramen and bread.  alas i don't even have money for that.  due to my hours at work getting cut (i make minimum wage at a bowling alley) and just having paid rent i'm looking at 2 weeks with no food or ramen if i'm luckily enough to find some change in the parking lot at work.  

how did i get into this position one might ask, well here is a brief backstory.  i moved out here to arizona from ohio to try and get clean from a 7 year hardcore heroin addiction that cost me my own business (i used to own a pizza shop ironically) my girlfriend her life (she overdosed and died in bed next to me last year) and of course i couldn't pay for school while still on drugs and found myself on the streets.  i've worked so hard to finally get a job, albeit its meager and they are doing everything in their power to keep payroll costs as low as possible, and stay clean.  due to the state being broke i don't qualify for food stamps since i can afford my rent ( although barely) that seems to be the biggest deciding factor on whether or not i can get assistance.  i don't have any family as both my father and mother have passed away and both were adopted and had no siblings.  i just don't know what to do and am beyond depressed and fed up with life.  i work so hard and i can't even afford to feed my dog, let alone myself.  i just can't take it anymore, so i finally decided to actually ask reddit for help.  i would give anything just to not be hungry for one night.  if anybody out there is feeling generous, i don't know what i can do in return other than thank you daily for the next few months straight.  

about to give up on life,

[] broke chicago student kicked out of his home early from winter break.... my dad has been battling problems both with money and with alcoholism, and when i tried to mention it to him, he misconstrued it and went somewhat berserk. i left home the next day (yesterday) and returned to chicago several days before the dorms reopen. one of my friends was gracious enough to let me stay in her apartment, but i feel really guilty about both using her utilities and stealing her food.

i was just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to lend me a pizza that i can spread out over the next couple days. i went job hunting today and plan to spend the rest of the evening filling out applications, so i promise that i will return the favor as soon as i have enough money. thank you!

 - alexandria, va - mom of 2 would love to bring back pizza night this friday. hi all. i heard about this site on the radio, and i thought it was the nicest idea. i have been on both sides of this. able to give, and in need. we were doing ok until my boyfriend lost his job this past march. which is fabulous since around the same time we found out we were pregnant with our third child. so he has been pounding the pavement trying to find a new job, and in the meantime my salary gets stretched pretty thin. we use to have pizza night on friday with the kids. we'd get a movie from the redbox, enjoy a pizza pie and have a fun family night. its amazing how you miss simple things like that. i hope we are soon in a position again where we can give more, and need for less. heck, i hope we all are. times are just hard, jobs are scarce and i just hope things get better for everyone. but if you are in the position to provide pizza night for a grateful family, it would mean a lot. maybe show the kids that yes, money is tight...but not everything is changing. things are going to be okay. and i will surely pay it forward. thanks for reading :)
studying for orgo 2 and gonna watch the new south park! a pizza would be dope. []. it would be super dope!! and i am sure my roommates would appreciate as well.
[] brampton, ontario. would love a pizza pizza gift card... hey, i'm from brampton, ontario, canada. i created this account to post here, as i was refferred by a fellow redditor. would someone be willing to send me a gift card to pizza pizza? any amount of money is good, but prefferably 20$. if my request is filled i will surely return the favour in the future!
[] college student, no job, haven't eaten all day. i'll even take a small pizza, anything really.. i did go out to eat last night to bond with my stepsister and i spent my emergency money and then i gave away my left overs to a beggar. i had such good pasta and bread in there man.
[] [moreno valley ca] broke and no job.. been looking for a job for 6 months and to this day i still have no luck. would appreciate it if someone can help a brother out.
i have 19 dollars in my bank account. []. things haven't been great, honestly. they haven't been horrible but, well fuck it.

i'm a broke college student. i lost a lot of money on a bad business investment (not as sketchy as it sounds though) and i've had to turn to sketchy odd jobs and prostitution in order to pay rent.

i mean i'm getting a new job with my college soon, which is great. but that doesn't even start until...later &gt;_&gt;

alright so my life isn't that bad. but seriously though can i please have a pizza? there must be some other white, too rich for student aid, too poor to pay for college (literally 90% of my college is being paid for on loans) person who understands my plight.

also i know my username says conservativevictory but if it helps my case i voted for jon huntsman and then ron paul out of spite to romney. actually voted for gary johnson even though i'm really not that far right at all just because i didn't care for romney and johnson was a pretty good at being a governor imo.

anyways srsly though please get me food =/ i literally have like, 3 ramen left.. not sure what happens after that.
[] gainesville, fl, us - college kid trying to find job for summer term. hey guys, so i started my summer courses and i've been trying to find a job but have had no luck so far. my money situation is looking kinda bad and i would really appreciate it if i could get a pizza to hold me off for the rest of the week. this is my first time so once i find a source of income i promise i'll fulfill someones request. thank you so much!

[] pizza in ottawa? my girlfriend is very sad.. update: she woke up, i'm cooking dinner. butter chicken &amp; rice. no pizza needed anymore. thanks for the kind wishes all!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

came home from group to a girlfriend who has cried herself to sleep because her friends have bailed on plans with her again. hell, one of them has bailed on treating her like a human being anymore in general.

i want to have a treat for her when she wakes, but we're running on empty money-wise. she loves pizza with chicken and bacon on it, but if that can't happen, i'll start cooking for her as soon as she wakes up - just don't want to make any noise right now and wake her up because she actually looks peaceful (although puffy-eyed from crying).

[] anderson, in. the last week has been very tumultuous, at least by my standards. i had to deal with writing several papers for school while treating head lice, the water and internet being shut off, and very little patience. life has certainly picked up a bit. 
the water has been turned back on, the head lice has been treated, but i'm still stuck writing several papers, babysitting, and working with a limited food supply. i'm not trying to create a sob story, it's just how things are at the moment. i do plan on giving pizza in the future when i am able. heck maybe i could even give back to you. 
my roommate's daughter is at the sitters for the night, we're getting ready to watch some really bad movies while i work on some papers. we'd like to celebrate the fact that she just gained employment and passed a test. please help me out so i don't have to live off of one box of rice and a very limited supply of coffee. 

[] in chicago with a , though not for me.... hi everyone!

first time requester here and thanks for reading. i'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. i think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves reddit as much as i do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. if you're interested, i want to provide some history so you know where i'm coming from and why i'd like to see that smile. i'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)

about 3 years ago i lost my job in marketing. i was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. i set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.

after about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  i realized i hated what i was doing. i was 25 then... 2 years ago. 

it's strange and hard to describe, i think, unless you've gone through something similar. i worked hard, ever since i was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. when i was 16 i got a job at best buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. i sold on the best buy floor for about a year, then went to compusa where i worked as a commissioned sales guy. my first commission job and i was only 17. i made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. 

by the time i was entering college i was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. that kind of money blinded me to the fact that i wasn't enjoying what i was doing... i was enjoying making and spending money. so much so that i burned through it faster than i made it. it was really the only thing i had fun doing, though. i dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since i was going for a degree i wouldn't want now).

i met my partner through myspace at about the time i had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. the first couple years were great. i was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. sometimes he'd come with me; vegas, nyc, seattle... etc. 

for his part he worked off and on. it was never a big deal... i made a lot more money than him. he'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. i didn't care because i'd rather spend my time with him when i was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.

so, back to three years ago when i lost my job. after about a year of coming up dry, i fell into a pretty bad depression. i couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that i didn't even like doing that work. it affected our relationship dramatically. i retreated into world of warcraft and stopped talking to family. eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. 

i hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. my parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. 

fast forward to today. my partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. we've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. my partner is working we're saving so i can go to school and do something that i do love; be a vet. he even got me a chocolate labrador puppy in february. we named him fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. the person i was 3 years ago would not recognize the person i am today.

i try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. that's what this request is about. we're not starving, but we live tight. this would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on reddit he will be amazed.

one day i promise to pay it forward. here's a picture of my dog, fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/soygy

[] 3 college kids starting the development of the next version of android's boycott sopa app. hey all. redditor [erenion](http://www.reddit.com/user/erenion), [wedgepiett](http://www.reddit.com/user/wedgepiett), and i are developing a follow up to our [android app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.boycottsopa.android) that allows users scan item bar codes and see if they're made by a company that supports sopa. our follow up app will allow users to join campaigns and will inform them when they scan an item if it offends any of their campaigns (eg child labor, sopa, etc). we're in the planning stages now, and are just starting implementation now...and well...we're hungry. we're looking at a few long nights of coding, and pizza helps a ton.

[ phoenix az] broke until tomorrow, will pay it forward or send you a small token of appreciation. well, 

i have been broke for the past month or so and have been sustaining myself on a diet of chef boyardee and hot pockets. i do still have a can of chef boyardee left, but it's stomach churning just to look at. i'd just really like a hot (not microwaved) meal. 

the good news is that i will be getting some money tomorrow, and will be happy to, at the discretion of the pizza donor: 

1) pay it forward with another pizza gift on this here subreddit or; 
2) send my donor a fully functioning, used, xbox 360 hard drive (20gb). 

verification provided upon request. thanks!
[] ontario, canada - would appreciate a pizza pick-me-up :). i've been pretty discouraged this week in terms of finding employment, monetary problems, health issue and so on. i'm a bit too self conscious to really dig into it but if you need proof of my lack-of-funds, i'd be more than willing to provide that for you.

in this request, i hope for more than pizza but the kindness of a stranger to help me lift my spirits during my time of need by filling an empty belly. this is a hard time in my life but i'm hoping this request will help things turn around! :)
[] a pizza to surprise my mum with! :). (a bit of background: i broke my foot in may and since i lived alone at the time and was unable to use the 3 flights of stairs to my apartment, i moved back in with my mum for assisted living, basically--until i can get back on my feet. **i'm still in a effing cast! ugh!**)

anywho, we're leaving this evening to visit my grandma 12 hours away and mum's still running around trying to get everything ready for our trip and as much as she can for when i return home, seven days ahead of her. i'm trying to help where i can, but there isn't much i can do with a broken foot. having a raop delivered (i broke my driving foot) would accomplish a number of things: **1.)**resolve the issue for the last meal in town. **2.)**not dirty any dishes for her to wash.  **3.)**be a way i can "help"/show my appreciation. it's something nice for her and she totally deserves it.

we live in tennessee and i would be happy to answer any and all questions anyone asked. :)

[] empty fridge, no cash. pizza to get me by until friday?. well, my rent is paid up until june, and [my cats](http://i.imgur.com/t7pmoh.jpg) have food. i just ate my last package of ramen, and i forgot to save some cash for me to eat!

i by no means need or deserve a pizza. i could’ve planned out my spending a little better. [my fridge is empty](http://i.imgur.com/ixvid.jpg), but i do have some pasta or rice i could make.  getting a pizza would be the highlight of my spring break. and when i get paid on friday, i would love to pay it forward.

[pizza received!](http://imgur.com/phh2e) (4:51 pm cdt) thank you, your_never_alone!!

[] out of everything. i heard about this site several months ago on abc and didn't think much of it. i am completely out of food and money. i have asked friends, family members, and even my church. my friends and family could not help, and my church turned me away. i have never felt so depressed and alone in my entire life. i really just need to talk to someone. 
[] ca, usa; would love some pizza . pretty broke, n hungry.  thanks if you can help!
[] power just shut off in oregon. hi, raop. so, things are bad: i'm waiting on help from my relatives to pay rent (late) and utilities (also late). my girlfriend and i haven't been able to find work and are having a very hard time making ends meet. the power was shut off this morning, and we don't have enough money to get it turned on--or any food that doesn't require cooking.

i'm looking into getting help from relatives sooner rather than later on the power bill, but i don't know exactly when that's going to happen. at this point, i'd judge this request to be more of a need than a want. 

full disclosure: we've gotten pizza through raop twice. once was through a request a few weeks ago, and the other was a totally unsolicited offer after my girlfriend got into a conversation with someone here. both times we were a bit better off than we are now, but we didn't have much to eat in the house and we couldn't afford the pizza ourselves. 

oh, i should mention--i have a battery backup that's giving us internet access at the moment. it'll be out of juice sometime today, so we'll either use the last of our batteries to use a nearby wireless network or head to the library. 

thanks for staying with me through this wall of text. 

edit: girlfriend said i should offer proof as there's been a lot of fake requests and offers here lately. we can give you a picture of the shutoff notice, or something like that. reply or send a pm.
[] pizza for a canadian who doesn't want to walk through the snow!. im going home for the holidays tommorow, but im completely out of food! i would have to walk 25 minutes to buy one meal. a pizza would make my night awesome! thanks

[] seattle- two broke girls that hunger for pizza.. the lease for our apt is up here in the next week, and we will be moving back to the midwest, but the cupboards are bare as our checks have gone entirely to bills / moving expenses (shipping your life is $$). would love to have something besides the leftover ramen in the fridge to go with the night of cleaning ahead of us in the empty apt. we will pay it forward!
[] hungry in pennsylvania. hi roap! i am going through a rough time right now. my fiance left me recently and going from a two income household to one hasn't been easy. especially with debt from some credit cards and loans in my name that were used to benefit the both of us. i will be honest i am not starving to death, but i am really upset and it would really cheer me up to have something with flavor to eat. ( i have been eating mostly oats, rice, and beans ) i am willing to use the verifaction system to check my ip and email to prove i am not a scammer. thanks!
[] could really use a pizza tonight! (virginia, usa). honestly, it has just been months since i've had a pie. student loans are keeping my fridge pretty barren. would really appreciate a piping hot slice right about now!
it's just me, voyager, a blanket, a ball of yarn and a crochet hook this friday night.  [vt]. i made the genius decision to avoid my drunk ex-boyfriend who usually is so wasted by 7pm on fridays that he starts harassing me at the bar with "i know i just dumped you but maybe it was the worst decision i've ever made" by staying in tonight. i've also made the genius decision not to drink which would inevitably cause me to pathetically text him until he pays attention to me. i'm craving extra cheese pizza like whoa. if someone feels generous, help a bitter lady stay in and watch star trek. it would restore my faith in the fact that a lonely reddit life is absolutely better than the real world.
edit...so many likes...no pizza. :(
[] just moved (ontario), out of money and 
ramen.  trading steam games/items or freelance 
development. i just graduated and moved into a new place in southern ontario (think london, st. mary's and surrounding area).  i'm functionally broke for 4 weeks, and would love a pizza, since they keep well in the fridge and can stretch over a couple days.  

i have some games on steam that i'm able to gift:
half life 2
half life 2: episode one
kings bounty: the legend
puzzle agent

i've also got some tf2 items (nothing great, i don't really play it) http://i.imgur.com/amw9k.png

i hope there's someone out there who would be interested!

() london, kentucky. need help feeding kids. will repay. please help.. well where do i start? two years ago the love of my life dumped me because for 6 months before that i had become a drinking machine. it wasn't just when i was depressed. i would drink when i was happy, sad, hungry, tired, stressed. i would even go to work and school drunk. it became a major problem when i got alcohol poisoning. to keep her from leaving i agreed to quit drinking completely and start going to meetings. suprisingly, it worked and i was on the fast track to living a much better (happier) booze free lifestyle. in the past month my girlfriend and i have argued constantly. thursday night she confessed she had been cheating on me for about three months with my bestfriend, who had also helped me stop drinking. my gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and "one thing just lead to another" and they had fallen inlove. this had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when i got custody of him. yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. i tried to go about my day the way i would any other day, i went to my aa meeting got my 24 months sober token. i went to work and got through the day as best i could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. after work i went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. i didn't know what else to do. i wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. i don't know how i am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live. my bills are adding up quickly and we have no food. my landlord is very strict and will not bend on my rent because we've only lived here for 90 day. i am but sure what to do. school starts next week and i can't get supplies or outfits. i used my last bit of gas to go to a food pantry only to find out that i make too much money for assistance and i can't get a payday loan because i got one two weeks ago to help fix my now exs car. i hope someone here can help me or direct me somewhere i can get help. thank you for reading. 
[] my best friend is in texas (i am in nc) and i just want to let her know i was thinking of her :).. i really miss my best friend brittney and i don't get to talk to her much since i am a full time student, have a 2 year old and work full time. i would love for her to know how much i miss her! 
[]last cheque's being.held until tomorrow and would like to eat. my pay cheque is being held until tomorrow because i deposited it in an atm last friday and didn't realize there would be a hold. stupid move on my part. anyway would love to eat tonight and now will have 800 coming into my account tomorrow. i got on direct deposit so there won't be a hold. will try to put an offer up tomorrow regardless of if anyone chooses this or not because i know how much joy a simple act like this would bring.

thanks raop, keep on doing what you're doing, you're making the world a better place.

[] pizza tonight to show parents appreciation.. my german teacher told me about this site yesterday and it took some time to actually find it. i am 17 and want to show my 'rents i appreciate them. my mom is great, but this is mostly for my step dad who is like a real father to me. i just found out that he has been making payments so i can go on a trip to germany with my class this summer. we don't have that kind of money. i don't have a job 'cause my mom wants me to just worry about school and keeping my grades up. i would love to give them pizza for dinner. if anyone wants to help, i would be greatful. i read everything and if someone can just make sure i do the verification thing right, i would appreciate it. we have 4 ppl in my house, my 'rents and me and 11 year old sister. thanks.

[] northern california. temporarily out of cash, would love a pizza instead of bumming sandwich money off my roommates.. college student and i've lived mostly off of rice, oatmeal and a starbucks gift card i found in my apartment for the past 2 days. i could really use something more substantial but true to undergraduate form i'm out of cash right now. a delicious meat and veggie topped pizza would really hit the spot. if i'm honest i could bum some sandwich money off a roommate and overall i'm hardly in dire straits but i'm sick of hitting my friends up for minor things. just a college student with a stomach that's as empty as his wallet. i'd love a pizza to study with tonight and to eat cold for breakfast tomorrow morning.

[] college student being completely honest about her circumstances!. i just decided to take 21 credits this semester, which is an insane amount compared to the 12-15 i usually do.  i've been up since 5am doing the first two weeks of homework for as many of my classes as possible, which sadly has only been three.  i'm exhausted, and in the least self-entitled tone i can muster, i feel like i've earned a small pie.  

woo!

oh yeah, and location: arizooona!
[] out of state, and out of money. i'm going to keep this as short, but still have it make sense, as possible.
i intended on moving to pennsylvania from nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before i left that i'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.

so i drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, i spend practically all of my money in doing this.
i get there and everything is fine for about a day.
he decides that i cannot stay at the house when he's gone (i am almost 22), so two or three days after i get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone i didn't know, don't go. i drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.

the next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if i'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows i tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. screaming at me that i'm a liar when i did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. so i gather all my shit up and call my uncle. he says i can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. 

i'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone i know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because i spent $300 driving across country, no job because i was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. my uncles broke and can't help me, the people i'm staying at frequently eat out. i have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. i came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. 

i'd just like something to get me through until i get the documents so i can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that i paid 1k for before i left) so i can get a bus ticket back to nevada. which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the dmv. and before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.
i don't like asking people for help but i love helping others. this will definitely be paid forward as soon as i can.

[] totally stuck. could use some help :/. firstly, this is a throwaway account because i really don't want my mother to know i'm struggling, and she stalks my main account. if you want to see my main account (its over 2 years old) i'll send it to you in a pm and prove its mine. :/

i got back into town today and all my roommates stuff has been moved out, along with every piece of food in the house. that means i have to pick up his half of the rent which means i'm really broke. :( a pizza would really help if anybody is feeling generous tonight. thanks!

[] pizza for my friend just out of surgery. my friend has a foot condition that he was born with. he was operated on one of his feet last year, and they just finished the other one yesterday! he needs to go through a recovery period of two weeks before he can start walking again, and i'd like to brighten up his day with a pizza because i can't visit him today (when two of my other friends are going).

he's not in any real need, but i think it'd be a nice thing to do since he's just an all-around great guy and taking this like a champ (and always willing to offer us food!)
[] upstate ny, had to spend food money on laundry this morning. me and my roommate spent our last bit of food budget on getting our laundry done and now we're hanging out with a friend and getting really hungry.

we should be considered minimum priority though because all of us will get to eat tomorrow and nobody's actually in danger of malnourishment or anything. plus if we get desperate we can call in the emergency egg noodle rations.

[] austin, tx - bank account empty until thursday, boyfriend got laid off :(. hi guys, 
normally i'm not one to ask for charity but i *really* need some help this time. i've been working a crappy, minimum wage job for the past year, and i finally got a new position working in a dental office (which is what my degree is actually in, but i haven't found a position until this past week), but i don't start there until mid-june. :( 
my boyfriend, who i live with, got laid off this past march and applied for unemployment benefits shortly after, but of course, nothing has been solidified on that end yet. i'm sure it's to everyone's surprise that the unemployment office isn't super reliable, right?...

so, i am here asking for some kindness to be brought upon us, as these past few months have been particularly trying for us financially. i am also in the process of recovering from a bad car accident a few weeks ago, so i've also had to worry about finding a new car, as well as trying to find a new, cheap apartment since our lease is up in july. sigh. growing up sucks sometimes.

to anyone that even took the time to read this, thank you! and if anyone even considers doing this favor for us, i promise you will be repaid in some form or another! you have no idea how much it would mean to us to not have to worry about dinner tonight. we are genuine people, we have just fallen on some hard times.

**thank you!**
[] missouri, usa - just got off work. i found out today that my wife left me for another guy. i sure could use a pizza. so, i didn't find out my wife was leaving me today, i found that out a couple weeks ago, but, i did find out it was for another guy today. worst day of my life, and i need something to eat, but i don't feel motivated to do anything, not even cook. i would be appreciative of whomever would like to help me out, and i'll pass it on when i get paid on thursday.

[] student low on money due to bills, awaiting student loan [wales, uk]. we all know that period between student loans when you're stretching every penny you have. unfortunately for me my housemates decided to shaft me by all buying stuff just before bills, meaning i was the only one with the money to pay them this month. this has left me with just enough to cover rent until the loan comes in later this month, but until then, and until i can get the money back from housemates, i'm a little on the food-light side of life.

any pizza would be much appreciated &lt;3

[] london, kentucky. just need a little help until we can get to the local pantry wednesday.. i am a very happy wife and mother to four children. we just moved which is killing our finances. we are constantly struggling with making it from day to day. i work full time plus overtime.....but i work for salary so the overtime is moot. my husband is struggling with a decision to go through the disability process at such a young age, or to work on a knee that desperately needs surgery but he doesn't have insurance. applying for disability is a long process and i don't know if we can wait much longer. anyway, i'd be happy to make it the next couple of days. we are blessed with a little help from food stamps and we have a very generous local pantry. however we're hungry now and the food stamps are long gone, mainly due to a refrigerator that stopped working and spoiled $100 worth of food. (really hard to stretch $250 over a month's time for a family of 6). we will get pantry food on wednesday and they even provide clothes. just need a little help to get by for a couple of days.

[]: washington state- the move from hell.... i wish i was making this story up, but unfortunately this has been real life for the last couple of weeks.  my boyfriend and i decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? so, last monday comes along and i decide to give her a call.  she doesn't answer so i leave a message, no answer.  tuesday comes and still no call back.  i have to go to portland that weekend for a baby shower and my aunt's birthday party, come back sunday and still no call back.  she calls me this monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. i pick up the keys later that day and i've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  we planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so i scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). so then, last night as i'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  she tells me that they are "resealing" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6am-6pm.  i start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  i give him a call and he is a total jerk about it.  at first i was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but i soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  now we can't even start moving until 6pm tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and i feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  i've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and i am pretty stressed and frustrated.  if someone would send a pizza to our new place it would make me (and i'm sure my brother...he loves pizza) the happiest mover that has ever walked the planet!

[] fayetteville, ar - alone for christmas and rather enjoying of pizza?. i'm not going to do the whole sob story, i'm just gonna say: 21, female, rather strapped for cash at the moment. i'm alone for christmas because i'm stuck in town working and all my friends are going and visiting their families like most average people. my next decent paycheck isn't until january 10th (i do have a very small one coming in on friday, but because one of my two jobs isn't active during the winter break, said check will be very small and immediately eaten by groceries). i'm not out of food yet and can probably make it until then. i'm just kind of lonely and really want a pizza.

i'm prepared to do that verification thingy mentioned in the sidebar. i am also prepared to make you a really bad drawing in ms paint, because i'm bored and don't have that much to do.

[][uk] having a crappy day, forever jobless, decided to swallow my shame and make a  for sliced love.. 20 years old and i've been unemployed since i finished a 6 month contract in march, and i'm living in my parents' loft. i buy all my own food and pay the very little rent that i can out of my jobseekers' allowance, and afterwards have maybe £10-20 a week to do what i like with (including putting money towards my damned £35/month phone bill that i'm locked into 'til august). but hey, it's had an accidental benefit of forcing me to cut down on smoking, 'cos that's just too damn expensive.

i had an interview and a whole bunch of assessments for a great job last week and absolutely aced it. i personally thought i had the job in the bag, and at the very end of the interview i asked when i'd be hearing from them - they told me i'd know today, and then said they've got a few more interviews to do first for *in-house applicants*. gulped, but whatever. got to today, and i've sat there next to my phone and checking my emails feverishly. it's now 9pm and i've had no call. so here's to more unemployment.

and frankly, i'm getting sick of cheap noodles and various soups and could do with something nice so i can play deus ex and feel at least a little better for tonight before i keep on applying everywhere and wait for my lucky break so that i can tell other people that a situation like this doesn't last forever.

thanks, reddit (:

[] i got laid off and missed my last final to graduate, i need a pizza.. what sounds like a pathetic sob story, is actually true. i was a merchandiser that got laid off from my company on 11/20. so, no money flow. i had three classes i needed to finish to grad with my degree and, like an idiot, i missed my last final and now my teacher has already gone out of the country (she's indian and won't be back till 2 weeks from today). i can take screen shots to prove all this if you don't believe me. basically, i'm having a pretty terrible holiday season.

figured it was worth a shot here to get a pizza to lift my spirits. if you donate, whenever i get a job or take that final, i will send you a pizza and breadsticks!!@#!@!!! also, if you want to ask me one question about the moon, i can answer that.

thanks either way and we should have a jumping high five in 3....2.....1

pizza [] for this cute little family in desperate need of help while moving. i have four days left in this god awful philly house and after the security deposit and first/last month rent, our bank accounts are developing cobwebs. my boyfriend and i could seriously benefit from a random act of pizza! it would probably last us about 2/3  days of dinner if we're good which is more than enough. the only one being spoiled with food in this house for the time being is the cat! any help is well appreciated! my friend told me about raop today when i told him how rough its been lately and that i've been sitting on reddit with a grumbly tummy. (figured i'd give it a shot) if this works out so much gratitude is given. 
[] trying to brighten my step dad's day. my step dad just got laid off. we're spending the day together, and he's really down. we've had a tough year, to say the least. he's always been there for me. he married my mother knowing she had a daughter and has treated me as his own ever since. i was diagnosed with ms earlier this year and i wouldn't have been able to cope without him. we're hungry and broke, and i would love to make him smile with a pizza. he's a great person. i'm trying to restore his faith in humanity, essentially. hope this works :)
(ing) conyers, georgia. it's my night with my children.. hello, my name is bret and i'm originally from south florida, now i reside here in conyers. i'm here to ask if someone would be decent enough to help me with some dinner tonight or tomorrow while i take care of my kids. i've been separated for nearly ten months now. i drank myself half to death and now i'm working on getting myself back to my feet. i don't have a job and my brother has been paying my rent plus utilities for the last two months. he can't afford to give me anymore cash at he moment, he suggested i try here because you gave him some pizza a while back. i really don't want to feed my kids the same slop i gave them last time. fish sticks and macaroni, a side of applesauce, they hate it and i practically eat it nightly. i've got two young girls to feed, if someone could help me i'd never forget it. hopefully that way their mother won't be so hesitant to let them spend the night with me next time they ask to. i'm here if you have any questions or if i left anything out. hope you'll be well.

[] nc college student with a lot of work for this evening. i've known about this subreddit for about a week, but i've been kind of reluctant to request because i see people who have either had really good or really bad things happen to them, and i would feel bad if i got a pizza they didn't. i still don't have anything really good or really bad happening to me, i'd just like a pizza and can't afford one, as well as i've got a lot of school work to do this evening. i worked through lunch (i just forgot) and for dinner they only had chicken (i worked at a chicken factory, so it's kind of difficult for me to eat chicken and not feel at least a little queasy), i ate a couple bowls of cereal but i think i'm going to be up pretty late as i'm also studying for a polisci exam on tuesday, and i am already getting the rumbles, if someone could help me out this evening, i would truly appreciate it and be more than willing to pay it forward.

[] (iksan, korea) feel like hooking someone up in another country?. like an idiot, i didn't budget well this month and have about 5000won ($5) to last until tuesday.  feeling a bit hungry.  korea has papa johns, dominoes, and pizza hut, but only dominoes has a website in english.  

if perchance someone hooks a brother up, i'll promise to pay it forward.
take pity on my diseased quarantined boyfriend who has been eating nothing but chicken noodle soup and jello for three days. []. okay , title was a bit dramatic.  but he is really sick.  he's been sniffling ,  dizzy , nauseous  and pathetic for the last couple days (his only days off this week)

his family is in a tough financial situation  (living on savings for the next 12 months until his mom's out of school and into a new job) so he's been eating jello  , and the chicken noodle soup i dropped off for him.

can we please get him something solid , delicious and pizza shaped to eat so he can get better and return to work tomorrow!? :(

()gallatin, tn car in the shop, no rental, no checks, no card. longer version of the story. i got engaged a few weeks ago and my fiancé wanted to visit her mother in buffalo. i let her use my car and she wrecked it. i should have got it back by monday. now it could be friday. i never had rental on my insurance because i never used it. took the rental back friday to save money since i was supposed to get the car back monday. so here i am. no cash on me. i used my last bank check sunday. lost my debit card. and the bank is several hours walking distance from me. i really want a hot pizza to improve my mood :( luckily i am not superstitious and taking it as a sign that this marriage is a bad idea because we have so much fun together. enough about me for now. let's talk pizza! and yes i would love to pay this back forward one i have transportation again! thanks!
() truck problems and pizza.. my fiancé and i bought this beautiful '66 ford f-350, knowing that we'd have to fix it up a bit....a bit turned into rebuilding the entire engine. we thought we could do it cheap, as my fiancé's dad used to own a garage where he put in many an hour. i even got out there and greasy to help! i learned a lot, but we've spent around $2,000, plus buying the truck (we were walking everywhere, luckily we live in a small town). so to wrap up this entirely too long post, we're broke and hungry, so if someone is willing to help us out, that'd be fantastic!

[] undergrad film director - poor and starving! woo! (atlanta). hey there raop,

i'm an undergraduate computational media major at georgia tech, which pretty much means i'm a computer science major except i specialize in things like film, user interfaces, video games, stuff like that. i'm directing a fifteen-minute horror movie for my english class, and i've been sick the past couple of days (which is a double bummer because we've had monday and tuesday off) so i'm in overdrive mode. i have all the work i can possibly do for tonight done and i'm just exhausted and still a little under the weather. i have also forgotten to eat today, and my meal plan is full for the week so i can't go to the dining halls :(

if there are unfulfilled [request]s from mothers with children or people who are literally starving please get me off the front page as fast as you possibly can, but if anyone can spare a pizza for a starving artist that would be awesome. i'll even put you in the credits of the movie under 'special thanks' if you want :p

i can provide a link to the course website as well as a picture of me outside the dorm as verification.

pizza or no pizza, have a great night, everyone!
[] hungry and celebrating a new job (finally!). hey guys, i'm new to this subreddit! greetings, i'm rin.

i've been applying for jobs since before summer started... i started a week before finals. this is the first job i've found this summer, though! and school starts back next month.

i'm nervous about the job, as it's a cold-calling and lead generation job.

and i could go for a pizza.

feel free to say "no", raop. or say nothing! or just wish me good luck on my new job, for hopefully soon i can afford my own pizza! and ideally, pizza for others, too!

humas vs. zombies is a game that takes part around an entire college campus. where humans are given weapons (we have socks) and are able to "stun" zombies by hitting them with our socks. our goal is to live for as long as possible. the zombies can only use their hands to "turn" humans into zombies. the 3 redditors are the last of 15 humans.

[] gf leaving, taking the dog i trained, friday i owe my mechanic $800 and i've been unemployed for 2 months since she had me move here for this failed relationship. feeling it. pizza would totally brighten my day.. as the title says, my gf is leaving me. we've been together for years. i'm pretty torn up. i quit my job and left all my friends behind to move to this city with her after she got a job offer here, and it's been a nightmare since i got here.

i came down here and interviewed, was drug tested, and filled out paperwork for a job before i ever moved here. however once i got here they told me they couldn't hire me because of a hiring freeze. i've been unemployed for 2 months and it is terrible - i've not had a gap in employment for 5 years. my girlfriend thinks i am a loser despite my taking care of our 3 cats and dog, doing all the household chores, and applying for many jobs and going to interviews. i supported her when she was unemployed in the past, but she does not care.

in addition my car is going to be fixed friday, which i desperately need so i can continue looking for work after my girlfriend leaves me. i owe the mechanic $800 and i have to drive 4 hours to pick it up.

i can't let this stuff get me down, i need to keep my head up and find a job here so i'll be able to support myself.

with gas and everything i am completely broke. this is my first time on this sub - if someone would be so kind as to gift me a pizza it would totally brighten up my life. i will pass it forward when i become employed. thanks so much!

 [] average sad story within.. so pretty much your average run of the mill request. me and my gf split up about a week ago, she is leaving and i am stuck with a lease i can't afford on my own, and have spent all my money paying for bills and gas to get to work. i don't get paid tell friday and i have eaten through all the left over roman in the house. could use a pizza to cheer me up and eat on for a few days. i'm not usually a requester and i am not horribly hard up, so if there is someone more deserving please choose them over me. thanks for considering my request and happy pizza giving and what not. 
[] i'm having a lotr marathon today!. so my  gf is out of town and i've caught up all the house work so it's time for a well deserved marathon with a neighbor.

, pizza for gf. i've been out of work do to a broken wrist for the last couple months. money is really tight, as i don't qualify for shortterm disability. my live-in girlfriend is super supportive, but we are both really stressed out due to finances. 

we haven't eaten out in months, and her favorite food is pizza. she has had to do most of the cooking and cleaning since my injury (hard as hell to scrub pots with one hand). i have spent all day cleaning the house, but to really make her evening, i'd like for her to have pizza.

**edit: bombtechdave rules.
[requ3st] so how does this work?. i dunno how to beg for pizza. my brother and i are sitting inside, i have some work to do in a couple hours which i will be getting a check for, but i can't cash it. tomorrow i should have worked enough to get my bank account up to zero dollars. i don't have a credit card, so the only way i could really pay it forward is by feeding the local vagrants. not having credit sucks, and mom doesn't get paid til friday. it's sad, but i'll have you know the reason i'm sitting here hungry is because i do favors for people and not all of them are able to express their gratitude in the form of money. totally missed out on the free artisan pizza, that would have been epic. 

i'm in new orleans area. my skitzo brother will likely record a rap for you which you can post if u like it. and i'll upvote it.

[] college student here - relatives left for upstate and all i have is some rice and a little bit of kielbasa. i'm a 21 year old college student who lives in brooklyn, ny.

i'm currently broke and all my relatives are away till sunday. all i have left is a bit of rice and kielbasa. probably enough for the rest of today, but i don't know what i'm going to eat tomorrow.

my relatives are in a bit of a bind due to credit issues, so in general we are usually tight on money.

i'm starting work training for my new job next week (worried about talking about it due to nda issues - similar to another post on reddit that caused lots of issues for the guy who posted it).

if i could get just a pizza, even plain, the smallest size, it would be nice.

i'm new to raop but this subreddit looks wonderful. i'm not exactly sure how this all works, but my name is johnny and i am hungry. normally i would get myself some food, but i have no money tonight.  i wouldn't normally ask for someone to buy me pizza but the alternative to raop would be to not eat tonight, so might as well give it a shot. i live in venice, ca. 
if anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated, and regardless when i have money i'll be back to here to help someone else out.
() single mum in wisconsin would love a late dinner with the kiddo. . hello. i have received once before in an offer post. i'm humbly asking again if someone could assist us with a pizza. we just got back from swimming practice and we're pretty hungry. we have some buttered noodles to hold us over, but we're pretty sick of those.   :p    thank you. 
 [] a pizza to help with depression and frustration. hello there. i've been having a horrible time the last few weeks in trying to find any kind of work and the frustration is killing me. my depression (dysthymia) has been hanging over me like a shroud. some comfort food would help me with this gloomy feeling and also be a fun dinner for me and my mom tonight. 

incidentally we were helped earlier last year by a fellow nyer. i wish i can find her again so i can return the favor (free graphic design work, house cleaning etc). she gave me hope to not give up and take the easy way out of life's problems.

[] college student stressed out. just found out i'm going to have to withdraw one of my classes because im not doing very well in it first year in college so stressing i hope i can make it through. in the bronx, new york

[] a student in huddersfield, uk, left penniless by student finance! :(. hello there raop! i am a student in good old blighty, and due to a cock up by student finance, i am yet to receive my loan, leaving me with no money. :( 
my rent is due in a few days, and that is the least of my worries, as today i've only eaten a semi melted toffee crisp :(
i of course will pay it forward, as soon as my loan arrives!

[] my two roommates and i are really hungry in prescott, arizona.. hi raop!

my two roommates and i are all full time volunteers working with americorps this year. we get payed less than minimum wage, and work full time serving people in poverty.

we're all really hungry right now, and we spent all of our money on rent and bills.

anyone care to hook three starving, hard working people with some papa john's?
{} some help tonight would be great. hello, my name is nicole, and i wish i could be here under different circumstances, last month my mother was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma it is a form of cancer that is very strong and when diagnosed with it the outcome is usually bad. she had an abdominal hysterectomy and we were hoping that it removed all of the cancer but it has not

mother went to the dr. today and we were told it has spread to her lungs and her throat, she goes to a different cancer/radiation specialist on june 7th to begin radiation therapy.

so i don't think this post belongs here and i honestly do not know where to post it, mom is sleeping right now and i am glad for that but i don't know what to do anymore.


i know i am asking so much from strangers out here and you don't know me from a hill of beans but i don't know what to do, my husband is working 2 jobs to help us and my mother and i am on disability for an old hip injury.

so if anyone can help please i would be grateful, please can you perhaps help us find a smaller home for rent in the sacramento ca area?

we are renting a 5 bedroom home to also care for my older brother who has multiple sclerosis but we can't do this alone anymore and i feel so lost, i am trying to be strong for mother, just like she has been there for us all these years and it is hard.

a smaller home could be even a 3 bedroom, we can make a living room into a sleeping area if need be but i just can't do this by myself and i am afraid of our landlord when he hears we cannot afford this home, i don't know what is going to happen and i am scared.

thank you for reading this and i am very sorry it is so long but i feel you should know about me before making your decision to help my us all.



[] this mom is really sick of ramen &amp; having a rough week..... not too much of a sad story, just an overworked, incredibly stressed out mama here who is very tired of eating ramen for all the meals. had a really crazy week, especially yesterday... and would love the relief of not slaving over hot stove for the kids dinner &amp; then eating ramen myself.

never done this before, so i don't quite know what else i need to do. but if anyone is willing to help... i can pay it forward on the 10th :)


ughh i thought i put this in the title. sorry! i'm in kansas city, mo :)
[] tired and craving some delicious pizza!. well, i've been a longtime lurker on this website but i rarely use this account.  after surfing the website for a few minutes i came across this subreddit so now i'm a little curious.

anyways, i'm not here to conjure up a sob story.  my summer has been pretty busy, between working at an unpaid internship since the beginning of summer and taking an online class to graduate a semester early.  i've been applying for part time jobs since may to earn money and i recently got hired at a restaurant.  things are looking up, but last night i only got 2-3 hours of sleep and i've never felt this exhausted before.  after seeing this subreddit, i'm craving pizza right now more than anything else.  i hope to return the favor and pay it forward!
[] hungry in va. . my bday is next tuesday and i was hoping one of you guys/girls would buy me a pizza from pizza hut or dominos today being the only places in the area. im tired of ramen and processed ham. i understand many people have less but today i'd like to eat and be satisfied for the first time in a while. when im in position to return the favor to random acts of pizza i surely will. just today i'd like a break. also, if it interests you i'm entering a program to get my associates degree in welding for two years where i will be living and getting an allowance to learn and pull myself from a negative environment. so contributing back wont take long. thank you redditers.
[] enable me to be a lazy bitch and not cook dinner tonight.. single mom here. so, my oldest is almost 9. she came down with strep three days after school started back. yay. =\ had a semi stressful weekend with trying to keep her and my youngest (almost 11 months) apart so the youngest wouldn't get infected too. however, the baby woke me up at 2am yesterday morning with a faucet for a nose and a slight cough. called the doctor to see if that warranted a visit, and low and behold it does. she was also positive for strep. she's a really good baby though, and except for being off her bottle (i guess the sucking hurts?) a little bit, and hating to have her nose wiped, she's dealing amazingly well. 

so to sum it up, i've got two sick kids and i'm behind on household chores (anyone got a laundry fairy they can spare??) and i'd really just like a night off from cooking dinner. i'm not desperate for food, and i totally understand if there are others who are and you'd rather help them. 

we're in metro atlanta, and are happy with any of the three major chains, but we also have hungry howies and bucks pizza who both have online ordering. my oldest only eats cheese, and i'll take any meat product on the other side. allergies to mushrooms, so please none of those. :) 

i hope that's enough info.. but if not, feel free to ask me anything. :)

[]hungry, only have pop tarts to eat :(. well, i'm hungry, and my mother is pretty poor for the past few months so my dinners consisted of poptarts or ramen for the last month or two. would be nice if i could get a pizza from dominos or something tonight :]. 

edit: forgot to say my location is long island (ny)
[] central florida/ucf area. i've recently graduated university. i think i have a pretty decent resume (working on a successful political campaign, interning at a congressional office, etc) but i cannot for the life of me find a job. not having a car in a very difficult city to commute in is definitely a problem, but it doesn't stop me from taking the bus. but i can only go so far. a two hour bus ride makes an 8 hour day become a 12 hour day. and scheduling multiple interviews is difficult when i'm relying on the bus to take me. nevertheless, i'm still pushing through and hoping that if nothing, walmart will come through.

so yeah, i have to move out by august 1st. my roommates want me to sign a new lease at a different apartment complex to move in by july 22nd, but i don't know that i can do it. i'm almost absolutely broke and it really sucks. it's a mixture of embarrassing, frustrating, and sad. i don't want to move back home but i don't know what to do. i feel like i graduated and i did a lot right to secure a decent job or prospects, but i guess i didn't. i'm studying for the lsat and i'll take it in october. i plan on scoring well enough to go to a good law school, but that's so far away.

i dunno, i'm rambling. what's up raop?
{} random act of pizza. extremely hungry 17 year old.. i'm home by myself and i am on house arrest, so i cannot leave my house. i have absolutely nothing to eat in my pantry or my fridge. just canned pumpkin spice:(. if someone would like to help me out i would be very grateful and will pass the giving along to someone else in need when i have the means to. this is my first request from a fellow redditor, and actually any food is appreciated. i can provide proof of my ankle bracelet which prevents me from leaving.( on house arrest for too many curfew tickets. which is bull****.) i will also make you a video of when i receive the pizza and how grateful i am. 


location details: 
i live in southern orange county, san juan capistrano area. close to mission viejo and laguna hills.  

also, i do not come from a family of money so i would give an honest appreciation to anyone taking any notice to this. i just want some food. my stomach hurts and there's nothing i can do about it. i have no money and no other way of getting food.

[] seattle/redmond - laid off and hungry. don't want to get all bluh bluh with my personal situation, but.  tl;dr, got laid off recently and cash is tight like spandex at the gym.  things lately have kind of felt like this:  http://i.imgur.com/mimsy.gif

[] a chance to affirm your faith in humanity, while helping us with our debate!. good day kind folk of /r/random_acts_of_pizza;

as stated in the title, my class is holding a debate on the true nature of man, good or evil- myself and half of the class on the 'good' side, the other half on the 'evil' side. while myself and my peers discussed various properties of our assigned moral alignment, the concept of charity came up in discussion- and some of us being redditors, we immediately thought of this subreddit.

it would be greatly appreciated if someone could send us a pizza of any size and type (preferably something generic) around 8:35am pst, october 13th, and hopefully inspire our pessimistic peers to see past the idiocy and greed omnipresent in our media and wall street and realize that there is such thing as pure human charity. **we remain committed to returning the favour to the subreddit as well, to an equal or greater value than the sent pizza :).**

note: we do not intend on using any sent pizza as a bribe, if there is enough to share with our small class of 15 people (it's an alternative high school) we will. we believe we have a solid argument and the pizza will be delicious evidence :).

thank you /r/random_acts_of_pizza for your time!

[] kansas city, kansas. help me cheer my husband up please!. hello everyone! i'm usually a bit of a lurker on here but i decided to ask for some help today. my husband is feeling really depressed today, we both got laid of from work a few weeks ago and haven't started getting unemployment yet/found work...things have been very hard. we used what money we did have on bills and rent. we have run out of food in the house (today is the first time this has ever happened) and won't be able to get any until we can go to the food bank on tuesday. i would love to be able to surprise my husband with some pizza please. i know a treat like that and a funny movie will help make him feel better for at least a little bit. i will only be able to reply to pms sent before 4pm central time as i'm at the library (one of the bills we had to cut was internet, ugh).

[] knoxville, tn. posting here in hopes of pizza. bit of a story!

husband works constantly to support us. right now i'm 23 weeks pregnant (see r/babybumps) and after moving back into our apartment due to mil troubles we're broke til next payday. it's my fault that we're broke which is why i'm secretly posting here while husband is at work and cannot see it. insurance refuses to cover my prenatal now for some reason so our spare food/gas money has gone to those. 

i am out of work sadly (was collecting ssi for my disability but they cut it off as soon as i got pregnant and no one wants to hire a pregnant woman even for a temp :(  )

so just hoping for a meal for when husband comes home from work :(
- friday night delight on a super cold night?

my little family of two and one cat would love to indulge in a pizza. we have been going through some tough times recently. we just paid the rent and now have 24$ to our name. we are going to do whatever we can to have it hold us over until wednesday. a pizza is not a necessity but it would be a real treat. 

in exchange i can offer pictures of my adorable cat charlie (he has plenty of food so there are no worries there) and a promise to pay it forward as soon as i can. 

thank you random_acts_of_pizza!
[][us] starting a new job on wednesday, but finances have really taken a hit to where i haven't been able to eat much. a pizza would be absolutely amazing!. lost my job a few months ago and finding anything halfway steady has been hard to say the least. finally starting a new job soon and would love to celebrate with a real meal. i'm good and video editing and programming so if you need anything in that field i can assist!

[] a simple pie of pizza.. my hard working dad works as a wholesale selling electronics in ny and business is slow lately and he isn't making money like he used to. my mother is a stay-at-home mother who has never had a job in her life and our family has a very tight budget. while some people may say to get off yar lazy arse and get a job, quite frankly in my situation its impossible as of right now. i'm too busy to get a job again to maintain my grades and enough sleep each night so that option is out of the picture.

all i'm asking for is a simple medium/large pizza, that's all, it would really make my day for a stranger on the internet to perform such an act of kindness.

[] held hostage by mom's crazy diet. * 17 years old with type 1 diabetes

* car in shop getting fixed
* can't leave 

that's basically the jist of it. i've recently spoken to my mother about no longer participating in the diet, but she agreed that i must now cook for myself. only problem is that there is nothing but potatoes, beets and carrots available for consumption for now. 
[] washington state, pizza sounds great right now!. i would love a pizza right now.  i don't need it; there's no sad story to my life that would make a pizza truly beneficial right now; i just feel like eating pizza.  i understand if no one wants to buy me one, but i would greatly appreciate it.  if you want, i could photoshop your name to look cool or something like that.  this is my first time asking for pizza, so if you have any kind of request in return, such as a wallpaper, i will gladly oblige.

[] family of 5 in search of some pizza. long story short my husband and i both worked at the same company driving medical supplies to and from hospitals. we were required to use our own vehicles because the company only had so many (that were breaking down anyway).  the transmission went in my husbands car and our boss told him that he refuses to pay for the gas to run the stuff in a van instead of his car that he can't afford to get fixed and fired him.  we were in a tight spot in the first place because we're constantly spending our money on fixing the cars (that we still owe $10k on) + necessities. we have an infant, 9yr old, 11yr old and a pet dog. ever since he lost his job we've been eating nothing but cheap things (hamburger helper, ramen, hot dogs) for at least a month.  we were accepted for food stamps but with my income they only give us $150 per month which lasts us a week with the amount of food my boys consume. my husband has had interview after interview with no luck whatsoever. i think they'd be really happy to come home from the pool tonight and have a great feast of pizza. 

tldr; we're broke and sick of the same dinner table scenery and would really like a couple pizzas tonight.

we were taken care of! thanks so much to mamagrr!
[] fort myers, fl i just ate my fiancee's burrito. i was absolutely starving so i ate my fiancee's burrito that he had in the fridge (and yes it was amazing). he is asleep right now and doesn't know it yet. maybe waking up to pizza would make him forget about burrito? 
[] fort wayne, indiana. i'm a software developer who is working on contract work week to week and this week... things came up slightly short.

my girlfriend has come over to my place for the evening and she just expressed the want for a pizza and as i sit here looking at my bank account i've realized i'm overdrawn for the week thanks to the dentist.

so i've come looking for a pizza. after being a long time reddit lurker i've registered and decided it is time to see what happens with this.

don't worry... i'm verified.

[] fl: rip ryan. my family is grieving now over the loss of our dog, ryan. my kids are 
handling this as best as they can, but more than anything we could really all use a hug right now. 

about two weeks ago, i came home to find ryan walking into the wall. i picked him up to see if he would recognize me, but he wasn't his playful self. i rushed him to the vets, where he was kept overnight. the next evening i got the news that he needed to undergo liver shunt surgery. his surgery was scheduled for today, but he passed away overnight.

this little angel went through many bouts of going to the vets. some 
days he was bouncing around and playful, and some days he wouldn't do much of anything. i didn't think he could have been suffering from 
something so serious.

i'm doing my best to be strong for my children, but ryan was like one of the children. i haven't been able to do much of anything today, and i'm hoping someone out there would be willing to buy dinner for my family tonight. outside of struggling to pay bills, we've now lost a member of our family.

[]bit of a tough month, would love a cheer-up pizza in lynnwood, wa. hey redditors,

it has been awhile since i've been on here. january has been a really rough month and i'm just having a pretty crap day. here's how january went for me. car broke down at the beginning of the month, which means i've been busing until payday on friday. my grammy passed away suddenly from complications from lung cancer on january 11th. being alone in wa meant a very complicated and extended grieving process as i couldn't get down to oregon until the day before the funeral. came back up and found that on top of my car being broken down, my tire went flat as it sat there completely still and parked meaning i'll have to get it fixed and replace a tire now. then yesterday i was on skype with my boyfriend who is an airman and already far away in omaha and he got orders. they're for japan. and he leaves in april. we had plans for his leave in june. those won't happen anymore. so today i am just sad and teary and majorly craving pizza. i do promise to hop back on after payday and pay it forward, i know how much a pizza can brighten a day!

[] unemployed couple could really use a pizza. my boyfriend and i have been unemployed 7 months and 3 months, respectively. we aren't starving but we don't really want to eat beans for dinner tonight. it would be a huge treat to have a tasty pizza instead. we would really, really appreciate it.
[] atlanta, ga. this week is going to be 
tight due to rent and buying a new hard drive after 
mine commited seppuku, so i could use some help.. i know a hard drive sounds like a luxury but i do online classes and there's no way i would have been able to go two weeks without a new one and rent is due tomorrow. i brought all my cash together and have just enough to pay it and my water bill. i know it sounds kind of snooty, but i can't/won't eat ramen. i grew up poor and it was dbreakfast/lunch/and dinner for 5 days out of the week. it turns my stomach now. i understand that i've been pizza'd before but that was over a year ago and i have paid it forward. i would appreciate any help and will be able to return the favor either to you or a person of your choosing, or just a random hungry person. thanks :)

edit: i have posted and received a pizza but at some point in my reddit career, i deleted all mention of my ex, therefore, i have received before, but i have paid it forward. i deleted it without thinking i would use this subreddit again.
i need pizza . i have not eaten for 9 hours i need some food. preferably a meat lovers lol. c: 
[] i'm starving and broke until next paycheck. only have cereal but no milk! would reddit help me out with a pizza?? austin, texas.. 
[] georgia, usa i would like a pizza.. i just want a pizza. i'm tired of eggs, ramen, and grits. a pizza for dinner would be rad. that's all. thank you.
[] stupid exams are making me hungry. will work for my food. in auckland. i live in auckland, new zealand, so remember that. this can be part of the thing that i do. i have a car, so anything within 5 minutes of [this](http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=orakei+basin&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x6d0d49b351cf3399:0x2a00ef6165e1e540,orakei+basin&amp;gl=nz&amp;ei=rjg3ttrrb9criqefpp3taq&amp;sa=x&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0cceq8gewaa) (like 5-10 minutes or so) is fair game. i can probably make it down to the waterfront. other cool areas are the former quarry turned residential area, the auckland domain, a marina, and an old train yard.

i have a camera and a tripod, so i can take a picture of myself doing something crazy.

edit: the pickups here are quite a bit cheaper, so if we organize it right, i can pick it up instead of a delivery. i am also partial to the mr. wedge from dominoes, but beggars can't be choosers. :)
[] worked all day, working all day tommorw and i'm broke until friday. i don't want to go to bed hungry!. there is really no huge story, i got pulled over last week and got a ticket ...so i'm  shortttt on cash. i'll be here friday night to buy the next guy pizza!!!
[] boyfriend broke up with me. could use some comfort food roanoke va. my boyfriend ended our relationship of 7 years to go back to his ex. about 6 months ago he got back in contact with his ex and i really didn't think much of it. alot of people connect on facebook, reddit, etc. so i didn't assume they were doing anything other than just chatting. turns out his "late meetings for work" were actually times where he would go out with his ex. i only found this out a week ago when i called one of his co-workers who told me they never had any late meetings. i confronted him when he got home and he told me that he had been spending time with his ex and was in love with her. he moved out three days ago and i've been unable to leave the apartment. i'm so depressed and i still love him. i've been bawling my eyes out for days just hoping he would just talk to me, but i know it's over. i could really use some comfort food and i don't have the money to buy anything. i've tried to budget rent and utilities and with just my income, i'll barely have enough for food and gas to get to work. i know i have to get out of this bed, look for a new place and get my head together. right now, i don't have the will to do anything. i hope someone can treat me to some pizza please. this would mean the world to me. thank you.
[] wa spent the last of my money on my sick dog.. i only get paid once a month and i spent the last of it taking care of my recently acquired rescue who isn't feeling well. pizza would just make this day better, been up since 5am taking care of a sic puppy.
[] hard up until friday. my roommate and i just had a bad week with rent and utility bills being due. not wanting to get evicted and not wanting to have our power turned off we had to pay both of them off which has taken all of my money until friday. this unfortunately dipped into both of our grocery funds quite deeply.

if anyone would be so kind to help us out with a pizza, i'm 100% able to return the favor this friday when i get paid.

*edit* i'm in ohio.

[] jobless, rideless, and foodless.. first things first: i'm twenty and i live with my mother. in tennessee. there's pretty much a whole lot of things out of reach for me due to the fact of residential areas being in the asscrack of nowhere.
i'm an amateur game developer who's studying to actually start developing but can't really do that without fuel for attentionspan. it's complicated.
anyway, if you send me pizza, i'll credit you by reddit username in obnoxiously huge, flashing letters in my first kongregate submission, snap into a genocide (whose gameplay is completely unrelated to the title).
and if you're a pretty rad dude for lack of a better agendered word, we can be friends.
and-- while i would love any pizza, pizza hut's kinda gross in this area.
i live in shannon glen, which is in spring hill. i encourage you to googlemaps it and see why i'm requesting. thanks!

[] wanna give my friend's 5 year old pizza for his b-day tonight!. i'm an employed woman that lives alone, i make enough to take care of myself, but no extras. i am going to visit a friend who is celebrating her youngest's 5th birthday...i bought her a cake, because she spent all of her money on buying him a yu-gi-oh set of cards and toys but i'd really like to show up at the door with dinner for them. i wont be ordering it this very minute, not for a few hours even but there is only a domino's in our town. please help and i'll try to send pics! :)

[] will work for food in reading, pa. i have been unemployed since march of 2011 through no fault of my own. i have taken odd jobs and sold everything of value. i'm not looking for sympathy, but perhaps some understanding if you've been in this situation before. things have been bumpy for me, but i have kept faith that things will look up. i spend my days looking for work, following up on applications that i've submitted, and just trying to figure out how i'll get my bills paid. it has been mentally and physically exhausting.

my bills are paid but i am down to a few cans of peas and ramen. i won't be able to buy any food until next month. i would love a pizza and savor every single bite. you have no idea! simple things like going to mc donalds or even just going out to eat at any restaurant..i haven't been able to afford to do this. 

because i'm a man with pride and work ethic, i would like to do some work for you. if you're near or in reading, i am offering to clean your attic or do some yard work. if you're not near reading, i will offer my computer skills to you. i can help you with anything microsoft office related. 

i am not new to reddit, despite what the bot may say. this is my first and only request. i am seeking to work for a pizza and i hope that this is allowed. i know this is random but please consider me. thank you for reading my post.

[] surprise shelter staff with a pizza!. just heard about this and rather than request a pizza for myself i thought how fun would it be for a surprise pizza to show up for the adoption and lifesaving staff at the animal control shelter i volunteer with several times a week.  its a rainy and miserable day, the shelter is extremely overcrowded meaning the days are stressful and filled with tough decisions being made for space.  i wouldnt want them to know its from my request but just a random act of pizza sent there way for all their hard work.  
the staff are there until 8pm eastern time.  im actually headed over to walk some dogs this evening and would love to see them enjoying a surprise pizza :)    even if we cant make it happen tonight..maybe another night/afternoon this week.  
pizza can always make a bad day a little better!

[] for two unemployed graduates away from family on christmas!. i've never done this before, but figured as it's christmas there may be a kind soul out there who would like to buy my needy friend and i a pizza for our dinner. sadly each of us fall into the hopelessly unemployed graduate archetype, and this is our first christmas away from home. we're currently huddled around my laptop for warmth as we're too afraid of turning the heating on. we would be more than happy to pay it forward when we find jobs. we are located in berkeley. thanks for taking the time to read this and we hope you're having a happy christmas day!
[] help keep me fed until i head home for christmas. . i figure that between a pizza and the rice that i have left that i can eat at least until i visit my family for christmas. i've set aside the money it will take me to catch a bus to join everyone for this "holiday tradition", but buying anymore food will be very tight until about jan. 2nd, when my next paycheck comes in.
happy holidays to everyone regardless of anything else. you people are all amazing and i wish you all the best!

[] sc couple on our last leg. i'm a student who is currently looking for work.  my husband works long hours, but (after a series of unfortunate and close-together events) we are completely broke.  in all honestly, it's inspired the kind of creative cooking that is fun every once in a while.  alas, we just ate our last bag of dry beans and our bank account is over-drafted due to unavoidable bills (will send a screen shot of bank account, if desired).  i'd like to say that we could pay you back soon, but until i find a job that's a promise i can't commit to.  i do, however, plan on getting more involved in this community once we're back on our feet.  i love reading about the kindness of strangers and would love to participate soon!  i'm planning on going to our local food bank tomorrow if this doesn't produce any fruit...i hate to do that because there is always someone in more need than i am, but when you're on your last packet of ramen, things get desperate!  anyways, thanks for reading and happy reddit-ing!

[] in need of cheesy sustenance in southern ma.. hello, everyone! i'm new to this website. i was chatting with someone on a different website about how it totally sucks when you're really hungry and someone calls you up telling you all about the awesome food they just made. it ended up turning into a talk about how i've only got enough food in the house for my little one to eat until saturday (which is when my food stamps refresh). so they linked me here! i didn't even know that something like this existed, it is amazing~

i've got to work tonight at 5, but my place of employment is right next to a dominos, so carry out would be the best option, if anyone is feeling generous today. i'd really appreciate it!

thanks for reading!

[] very hungry family. us + our two children. a family member who is usually here is in the hospital and the last few days have been hard for everyone. there is really no food to speak of and we won't be able to get anything until the 24th. 

full disclaimer, someone did get us a couple of pizzas 17 days ago. i feel like i should be honest about this being another request after a somewhat recent one from us. but we are stuck in such a bad situation this month, we called food banks to see if any of them could drop off some food for us (but none will deliver, even if you have no transportation, which we don't) and with $1.51 to our name right now, this is all i could think of. 

thank you for reading and considering our request. we very much hope to be on the giving end of things someday.
[]i will gladly pay you on tuesday for a pizza today. so i'm sitting in the living room of a lady friend of mine shortly after we have watched the movie bad teacher.  we are hungry, but sadly, shortly before i arrived for the movie, the contents of her refridgerator was removed for a little bit of maintnence and de-icing.  the dumpster is full of lost dreams of dinner, that sadly spoiled.  anyways... i introduced this girl to reddit tonight, and we happen to be hungry.  after about an hour of laughing our asses off at her reddit innocence, i remembered random acts of pizza. we want her first time to be unforgetable and satisfactory. thanks!
[] lincoln, ne i would like to not worry about one thing.. hi. these last two weeks have sucked, and i would really appreciate not worrying about one thing--namely, food--after all the torrential bad events i've experienced. in short:

* moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. 

* learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia

* got rejected.

* car broke down. towed for all the money in my checking. problem not found, magically starts running again.

* had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems

* discovery that i can't cook well, and i don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).

* my other grandmother, the gentlest woman i will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. 

* car breaks down again. again. fortunately, it magically restarts again, and i don't have to have it towed. but it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.

* i get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.

* grades come back. i am officially beneath the required gpa necessary to keep my scholarship. 

aside from the food courtesy of the funeral, i haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. i would like to have a few days where i don't worry about hunger.

[] poem for food ny. (i will write you a poem/haiku about whatever you want for a pizza.)

i got up hungry    
because my roommate is cheap    
pasta is not good    

my roommate and i take turns doing the grocery shopping, and this past week he ended up going. he brought back two cases of ramen, a 12 pack, and smokes. the 12 pack he downed himself the first night, his cigs are gone, and we are left with these little nasty packages of ramen. sad part is, the receipt didn't add up to what i originally gave him. can someone out there help two friends out with a meal that isn't soggy noodles? if you help us, your haiku will be posted for all to see. we will also supply [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/b0vnb.jpg), as that's just how we roll =)  
[] north of austin, tx - house we're renting has been foreclosed on and we could use some comfort pizza. hey reddit, looks like my family (me, wife, 3 kiddos) have to move house asap -- our landlord was foreclosed upon. we're handling the temporal stuff as best we can, but we sure could use some comfort pizza to help us out sometime in the next few days. we could even use the pizza boxes for packing! :-)

[offer, ] might be the wrong place.... i've been really craving a pizza.  don't have the money, and that's a story for another day.  today's story is this.  i have four general admission lawn seats to the rockstar enery mayhem festival featuring disturbed, godsmack, and megadeth.  the show is today in west palm beach at the cruzan amphitheater.  i'm trying to give them away.  if someone wants to throw a pizza my way, that's awesome.  if not, that's cool too.  would love to be able to give back to someone who has been helping others, so verified givers will be given preference.  obviously this is short notice, but they are electronic tickets and i will send them to you right away.  

hope someone can use them.

[] turlock orphan, looking for last good meal. . so you can read my iama about the whole orphan thing. basically i have nothing left, and its my last night staying at my friends house in turlock before i go back to palo alto, all ive been eating here is ramen, and i was hoping maybe reddit would be able to help me have one last good dinner, before i have to live in a shelter:). 
[] broke kansas college student that would love a pizza to get through this paper. . like the title says i'm a broke college kid that's working on a paper. i could do with something a little better than beef ramen if possible. i'll be sure to pay it forward when i start my summer job here in a few weeks. 
[] three year redditor needs food, badly. i went over my current fiances, and i 'think' i can make next months rent. but involved in that process has been cutting down what i eat, and especially how much. i've been basically living on beans, rice, pickles, and potatoes. now don't get me wrong, i'm glad to have anything. but i'm a little worried about what the lack of variation is going to do to my health. and i'll admit it, even more i just miss tasting a thing that has a flavor. 

i've been posting on reddit for over three years now, for what that's worth. i think more important is the fact that one of the reasons i don't have money now is that i wound up donating a lot of it to the homeless when i did...and then i lost my job. 

i do work now, but my total income is far below minimum wage. and i'm just scraping by. a pizza would mean more than most people would guess to me. i posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza/comments/iite6/thanks_what_pizza_can_mean/) about a week back, about what someone's gift of a pizza to me a while back, before this subreddit existed, meant. that's where the meat of my sob story is. 

tl;dr: lack of food makes me rambly and i beg for pizza. 

()just paid my first months rent and now my paycheck is gone (besides gas money) murray, ut. help i'm hungry!!

i'm here on campus to get some work done before the new semester starts. for the past few meals i have been subsisting on just rice water. in return, i can offer a (poorly) drawn on paint picture of your request! if you could help, it would be really appreciated. thanks and happy new years to everyone!
 for my 5 year old . i am here because my 5 year old son has been sick off and on since just before thanksgiving. he has had everything from strep throat (3x), ear infections (3x), sinus infection, pink eye, and the flu. he has now had vomiting and diarrhea and intermittent fevers since january. he has had several blood tests and labs done and we're hopefully getting the results back tomorrow. he has been tested from everything from food allergies and parasites to some pretty serious diseases. as of yesterday he has been feeling a bit better and is feeling up to eating something other than soup. i told him a while ago that once he was feeling better he could have whatever he wanted. well, my little man has chosen pizza and unfortunately i just don't have the funds to do this right now. (only have a dollar and some change in the bank) so, i'm hoping someone can be my little boys pizza hero before he's not feeling up to eating.
[] vermont, usa. having a miserable day, hungry and completely broke. details inside. . i have been stuck inside my room all day because i had a huge, blow-out fight with my roommate and i don't want to see him. i have no food here and also no money, and can't leave because i have nowhere to go and there is a thunderstorm outside. i have received a pizza before, a couple months ago, and also given one in /r/food_pantry. i have $6.30 in paypal also if someone would like to trade. thanks for reading!

[] laid up in bed on workers comp with a bad back. can i have a pizza please?. so i work for state mental health agency, i recently hurt my back breaking up a fight between a few of our kids at work and have been out on workers comp. which has delayed my normal pay so i'm a but broke. my neurosurgeon today told me i'll require surgery to fuse two vertebrae together. now, i've never had any kind of surgery before, so it's a little daunting to think about. i'm very optimistic about the procedure though, and i feel i lucked up with a very good cutter handling my issue. pizza would make me feel better though, that comfort food thing we all have at times. can anyone help a partially broken and broke guy out? 
[] no food until the second... pizza gestures?. forgot to put location - rhode island

so there are three of us living here. two adult males, and an adult female. 
somehow our finances were completely drained this month. no food, no money, paycheck isn't coming until the second, and we're apparently too rich for food pantries. 
our resident artist has said she will draw anything you like, and our resident... something has said he will thank you profusely as he has no discernable skills that can be applied to the internet. (he's really good at rpgs. doesnt help here.) 
now there are a thousand pity stories all over the4 internet, so we decided to add a bit of proof. pics of bank account, fridge, etc.

[] cold rainy and broke college girl, could really use some help. i just paid my rent with the last of my financial aid money from last semester and im sick and tired of eating canned meals. i feel like i'm a survivor of the apocalypse. would a kind redditor help me out with a cheese pizza. more than willing to pay it forward when i'm in a better position.

[] earthquake pizza?. anyone would be so kind to send me pizza? my lawnchair fell over and it was devastating to me and my family. my mother couldnt cook today because of this. we just sat together today recounting the tragedy that occured upon our lawnchairs. a day like today makes us grateful to be alive.

[] single dad wants better for kids. i just found this site through cnn.  i am deeply touched reading all of these posts.  both from those in need, and those looking to help.  it is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  there was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  it was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  those days are long gone.  in the last year i've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  i do get unemployment, but i'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  it's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  tv service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  we've learned to live on what we have, and i'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.  i make sure they're fed, but i can never give them anything above and beyond that.  it would just be really amazing to be able to surprise them with a pizza some night.  believe me, i know how fortunate i am to have a roof over our heads, and a car that works right most of the time.  and there are people i'm sure who need so much more than we do.  and as soon as i'm in a position to help them, i guarantee i'm going to be on here doing that.  god bless all of you.
[] binghamton, ny. i'm a bu student and can hardly afford groceries, let alone pizza. a real hot meal would mean so much and i appreciate anything any redditors here can do.

: mother trying to make it through the weekend. mother out of tampa florida with two beautiful girls who i would love to treat to a special pizza dinner this weekend. can't really afford to do anything extravagant for my daughters so i was looking for help to put a smile on their face with their favorite food.
[] a honest description of budget woes. i hope to end these couple of weeks on a good note.. for the past couple of weeks the college campus here has taken away a majority of money. this last week has been the worst as i contracted the usual bout of seasonal illness. recently i had to fill in applications to stay in their dorms for this summer, and also this fall. this has come with the unfortunate circumstances of rules, vague descriptions, loopholes, and lots of spending. turns out that if i only sent in one application for /both/ summer/fall at the time the summer applications were due, i would only have had to pay 40 dollars instead of 80. loopholes! d:

i do believe someone else definitely needs a pizza more than i do, and while i am finally getting better, i would like a pick-me-up from this frantic week. there's about 2 dollars in my account right now, and this is not enough for a pizza.
[] hey guys, is your refrigerator running? mine no longer is. (｡-_-｡). my fridge is busted, my house now smells like death and all the food (mostly delicious thanksgiving leftovers which i so looked forward to eating) is ruined. my landlord said he will replace fridge this week, but in the meantime i'm hungry and broke. will someone help this girl out with some pizza? thanks in advance from cali.  
[] a minor celebration to hopefully the start of something meanginful.. i won't pretend i would go hungry without this delicious doughy cheesy love, but i do have a story.  i just emptied the little money i had left in my bank account to register for classes at my local community college.  i never finished my degree and left and worked at a big company making good money for a while.  when that came to an end i moved and had no clue what to do.  i have been looking for work for over 2 years now.  i just recently had to move back home, and i am incredibly lucky to have a mother who would even allow such a thing.  she still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  hopefully i can be a positive influence to everyone now that i am living with my fam.  i know my little bro is going to love the three drumsets i brought home (he just started learning).  he seems genuinely interested in music, and i know that's one thing i can really help him with.  even though i didn't work over the past few years, i have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  i am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  my goal is to get back into a university in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in europe for a while (i love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).  i kinda did everything backwards, but i am actually excited about working towards my goals.  i would love to celebrate this new beginning with some pizza, but the few bucks i have to spend for myself are going towards bills and i want to take my little bro to go see the hobbit tomorrow when he gets off of school.  like i said, i wouldn't go hungry, but pizza seems like a good way to celebrate the first step in changing my path.

we all must face the consequences of our actions, and i want my actions to finally start having beneficial consequences.  a part of me is scared that i will just fail the whole college thing again, but i know i more mature now, and can accomplish what i want out of life.  fear is not an excuse to not try.  thanks for reading!  i know my story isn't unique, but it is mine nonetheless.

edit:  i guess it would be useful to know i live right near google hq in san fran bay area.
[] and [challenge] - south american raop ?. it's new year's day here in mendoza, argentina, and everything is closed.  no delivery.  no supermarkets.  no (few?) gas stations.

i've just moved into a temporary apartment while the mother and brother of a friend with a new baby stay in my apartment.  and i don't have much for supplies in the house-- i haven't had time to stock up on much other than gatorade and water.  not even a bottle of wine.  i think there are a couple of bananas and an egg...

is anyone up to the challenge of getting me a pizza today?  i'm in central mendoza (chile and colon)

i'll pay it forward. if you hook me up, i'll hook up someone up back at home.

help a needy family of 4 in cali?. hello, we've posted before when we first got to cali back in august, but never got a response so we thought we'd give it another shot. there are 4 of us here, 2 kids and 2 adults, just looking to see if there are any kind people out there willing to help us out with dinner tonight. haven't had the best of luck since we got to cali. yesterday was halloween, but kids didn't get to do anything other than go hang out at church cause we couldn't afford to do costumes this year. 

if there are any kind heart'd people on tonight willing to help us out this one time it would be great. i'll be able to donate $10 to someone on the 18th, i realize it's not much, but i've seen others like myself on here seeking help so i'm going to try my best to do help them out whether someone helps me or not. but once again we're asking if there are any kind heart'd ppl out there willing to help us this time we'd really appreciate it. 

thank you &amp; god bless
[ oh] i live in the worst part of my town. my family doesn't have much money, so i haven't eaten in the past three days. will draw for food.. there is a total of six people living in our small apartment. there isn't a much income coming in because it's extremely hard to find jobs out where i am. i've been doing odd jobs for the past six months or so just trying to scrape together money to help my grandma pay for our rent.  
i only eat a couple times a week because there isn't enough food to go around.  
if someone sends us a pizza, it would hold us over for about a week. it would be greatly appreciated.  
**edit:** i live in youngstown, oh.

[] hospital food sucks... how about a pizza instead?. posted this yesterday, no luck. just wondering if anyone out there might have a pizza to spare for someone who is out of luck temporarily to enjoy a pizza!

i'm from houston, tx.

i've been lurking here for several months, and for some reason this was the first place that popped in mind since i got home.

me and my sister were in a car wreck last thursday. we got t-boned in a parking lot by someone who apparently thought talking on their cell phone was more important than watching the road or applying the breaks... fortunately it was just her and i in the car and they hit the back passenger door, because had they of hit just a foot or two up, i don't think we both would have survived.
we were both taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and my wallet was left in our total'd car which was towed. hopefully it wasn't stolen or anything and it's still where i left it in the car.

anyway i don't want to ramble, but to sum it up, my sister and i would be very grateful to anyone willing to help someone out in a tough spot with some pizza. when things get settled out here and i get back on my feet(literally!) then definitely plan on returning the favor to someone who's in a bind and could use the help.

thank you so much!
[] texas usa. hi raop. if you couldn't tell by the username, i am broke. i have about 50 dollars to my name to last me until august 30th. if you're wondering why this is a throwaway, it's because i have family who know my main username and i don't want them alarmed at my current situation.

i was recently let go from my primary job and have about 12 to 16 hours coming in from part time work when i can get it. on top of that shitty predicament my car sprung a leak in it's cooling system and until an acquaintance can get to my city to help me do repairs i'm reliant on bumming rides off of people to get to/from work.

suffice it to say a little pizza would go a long way for me while i try to get back on my feet. [here is the only thing i can think to provide as far as proof](http://i.imgur.com/trd9c.jpg). not really sure if there is something i am supposed to do otherwise, i just found out this subreddit existed a few days ago.

[] midwest ky. been eating ramen for 5 days now... could really use a pizza. . i am stuck staying with my parents for a couple weeks in one of the most backwoods, behind the times, boring places ever.  there is nothing for a girl like me to do around here, and [this](http://untitled38057.tumblr.com/post/27547768540/ladelthia) is me. i don't quite fit in down here. it is very .... country here. the one redeeming factor is that they do have a few pizza places here. we have dominos, pizza hut, and papa johns! i have literally been eating the same three meals every day for the last two weeks. i eat cereal for breakfast, a bologna sandwich for lunch and ramen for dinner. i could really go for a nice pizza to wake my taste buds up from this coma. if you guys could help me out with this, i would greatly appreciate it! i will even take pictures of me eating that delicious pizza and post them for you guys to see! please and thank you?  
[] cut open my foot, can't move around, would love some dinner tonight.. i was working in the kitchen when i elbowed a steak knife that was on the edge of the counter (i didn't notice it, foolishly) and it fell onto my foot... proof is in the a post to r/health on my page (this is a throwaway account).

i'd be grateful to anyone who could help me out with getting a pizza. i can't go to an er until tomorrow (the only time i can get a ride to do so). 

if further proof is needed i'll take another picture of my foot with a date and time card next to it. thanks in advance to anyone with offers.

i understand that this is an odd post and i'm embarrassed about it, honestly, but i can't work in the kitchen to make top ramen tonight, hell, i haven't even cleaned up the mess on the floor yet. :/

edit:got to an er. still haven't eaten and can't walk. would still love a pizza if anyone's willing.

[] puppeteer in dc... late checks mean i had to choose rent over food-- now have $10 to last two weeks! a pizza would be a lifesaver!. it's a big deal to ask for this, as i'm the first to admit that i am very independent and hate asking for help, but i've got nowhere else to turn. 

story: i'm a freelance theater artist, and i depend upon a steady stream of checks from my various performing and teaching gigs to stay afloat. however, this week two theaters where i teach failed to send my payment, and while i've worked it out to have those missed payments added in a few weeks, i'm currently down to $10 to last me for food for the next two weeks! i am almost out of food at my house, and i've finally accepted that i can't just tough it out with no food for two weeks... so i'm turning to you, the reddit community, for help!

if you are able to help, i would be extremely grateful! thank you for reading!

[] my roommate has had a terrible day, and i'd love to surprise him with pizza.  details inside. hello! :)

my roommate is a 19-year old college student who has a beautiful baby girl (who was born while he was still in high school).  the mother is a year younger and takes care of her while he is at our apartment for university - but he heard today that his baby is sick and in the hospital.  he can't miss class, so he's stuck hours away from his baby in our apartment worried sick.

in addition, while riding on a bus to class, he took his keys out (it was about to storm) and put them in his hands to get into his car immediately after exiting the bus.  he left the bus, but apparently forgot his keys, and had to wait outside as it stormed for the bus to loop around (takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 45), then found out that the keys somehow made their way onto another bus, so he had to go back to campus, chase down the bus they were on, and finally get home.  all during a storm.

i'm broke for a few days until i get some money, and i'll definitely pay it forward down the line when i have some money to spend, but if someone could spare a few dollars and help get my roommate's week back on track, i'd love you forever.

edit: we live in baton rouge, louisiana

[] iowa;  haven't ordered pizza in a year, would be tasty?. i bought a new motorcycle yay!  http://imgur.com/a/lzzqz

just got my helmet and gauntlets in today. just excited to share, not really relevant.

 i haven't ordered a pizza in the 2 years i've been in ames.  i just don't like the idea of a poor guy driving a pizza out to me and feel obligated to tip well.  unfortunately i don't have much money so i don't order pizza.

that didn't stop me from buying a bike 0_o.  i only eat once a day, usually dinner after i get done working all day.  it doesn't bother me, in-fact my stomach is tiny now and i don't even notice i'm hungry.

i might go take a nap but i've always heard about this subreddit but missing the domino's pizza contest made me hungry for pizza, it'll subside after a day or 2 i hope but in the mean-time i wanted to post.

i went from 6'1 186 pounds (still skinny) to 163 pounds apparently this not eating stuff is really good at cutting weight.  i was trying to put on weight (muscle) though.  pizza doesn't really help with that though, don't know why i have a craving for it.


() redditor girl down on her luck, can someone send pizza? (mn). hey,

just a simple request for a girl going through some tough times. my elderly dog is being put to sleep tomorrow and there is nothing in the fridge tonight, and i'm already broke as it is.

i'm in mn, and i'm willing to provide any other information via pm, including verification if that is necessary. pizza hut or papa johns would be amazing for tonight, definitely would love something to go right for once, even something simple like this.

ps: i do have a verification code, (not sure how it works) 
[]. don't get paid until next week, would like to enjoy a pizza for the holiday weekend with the kids, i would truly appreciate anyhting.
[] pizza to release some stress for a night. .     i feel really down that it has come to this but, i have been out of work 3 weeks now and money is really scarce.  during this stressful time i wish to have a night of relaxing and a nice pizza.  the hunt for a new job has and still is quite challenging.  food is pretty tight as well and i am waiting for my food stamp app to get accepted.  if you feel like helping you would be doing me a nice nice favor.

[] flat broke and unhappy from unexpected move due to landlord error, don't get paid until sat. and very hungry.. my landlord double-leased the apartment we were staying in, resulting in them showing up last thursday morning to kick us out. we disputed and proved our lease wasn't until up until the 31st of august, but they did everything in their power to get us out early. they're supposed to refund our unused rent and give us a little extra, but there's no telling when we'll see that check. we've spent every dime we have moving into a new place; deposit, first and last month's rent, getting utilities turned on, etc. really adds up. we're looking at an empty pantry and totally bummed. if someone could get us a pizza for tonight we'd be incredibly grateful.
[] broke till friday, really hungry, sick of ramen noodles, would really love a pizza right about now!. had some issues come up this week, i can pay it forward when i get paid on friday! &lt;3 

i should add that domino's is preferred. 
thanks :)

pizza it forward []. i was looking up for possibility of free pizza and ran across the reddit free pizza at first was hesitant but i thought i give it a try. my girlfriend and i are in a tough spot, my job has yet to pay me my "lost" hours and we are behind with some bills. we have enough money to pay for rent tomorrow but it may be a week or so before we will get above. does anyone have it in their heart to provide a pizza for us? in return we will pay it forward to your choosing (i have just thought of a unique idea paying it forward) if interested i will share it with you. thanks for taking the time to read this.

[]  broke until tomorrow, starving today. anyone could please feed a starving girl from south florida. last time i asked i went to sleep to forget my hunger, so i dont know if anyone responded. ill try and stay up this time.  thanks in advance
[] pizza before oral surgery!. hello fellow redditors!  saving up for the $350 co-pay to have my wisdom teeth removed (too close to nerves).  a little light on cash for dinner today/tomorrow.  anything would be appreciated!
[] will write stories for pizza!. it's pretty much just like the title says. my cousin and i will write stories for pizzas. we prefer fiction(non-fiction makes us think too much :p), but we will try anything. i might also convince her to draw a picture to go with the story.
[] pizza after practice in so cal. would be perfect. two of my four kids play sports and  on two nights of the week they both have practices at the same time in different towns. my husband takes one to soccer and i take the other to softball. after that we head home for a fast dinner before baths and bed. tomorrow night it's suppose to be bean and cheese burritos as we are trying to stretch our food budget, not my favorite thing. a pizza would sure be great but cash is low until next payday. would love to find a pizza hero for the night. we have lots of choices nearby, pizza hut, dominos, papa johns and round table.
thanks!
d in cali!  http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/124589/danielle_crofford_fetters.html this is who i am&lt;/a? can't post a picture right now cause h and i had our  cell phones turned off to save money for a couple of months. 
[] father is 3-years clean, would like to celebrate (proof inside). proof - http://imgur.com/a/ra8gw

my father just recently got his 3 year sobriety coin, i planned on celebrating today but there was a problem at my work and now i wont be paid until monday, if there is someone out there kind enough to help us id be indescribably grateful.
[] my roommates and i are literally starving and have no money. would love a fresh pizza. . hey there, i live in toronto in a house of starving artists. all i've eaten today is oatmeal and i'd love a couple slices of actual food. i wouldn't have words for how much i would appreciate this. thank youu maybe i can trade for art ? i dunno 
[] kansas. craving pizza. i would buy one myself if i could.
[] in memphis, tn for a bachelor party but don't have much money to give the groom a fun night.. some friends and i are coming to memphis, tn in just a few hours.  we're driving up from little rock.  unfortunately, the best man recently got laid off and most of the rest of us are underemployed. memphis is about the furthest away that we could afford to go.  don't get me wrong, we are going to give him a fantastic send-off from the single life.  even if it means being late on bills next month.  but a little pizza kindness would be so amazing and would take some stress off.  the groom is a great guy and he deserves an amazing bachelor party.  we're cramming 9 guys in one room at the marriott.  message me if you just have a craving to help make a party a little more awesome.  thanks for reading.
[] i tore my labrum last night after slipping on ice. would greatly appreciate a pizza as i dont have any food in the house and dont get paid until wednesday.. basically the copays from seeing multiple doctors (general physician and then a orthopedic) drained my bank account and i dont have any food in the house. i would greatly appreciate a helping hand.
[] cheesy goodness for 4 adults.. out of the 4 of us only one of us is able to work. i thought it the right thing to do and try to relax with some pizza that won't cut into the bills. thank you.
[] fiance and i will be eating 2 packets of ramen per day for the next 9 days. info in comments. my fiance and i are both starting our second year of college, and we got an apartment this year.  long story short, she's from out of state, so her tuition and class fee's were doubled, and it ate up most of our money.  add in having to pay out of our pocket to clean our apartment we just moved into to make it anywhere near livable, and i'm stuck with $0.57 in my name until my paycheck hits the 21st. 

so... if you want to cheer two broke college students on a ramen-diet up, it'd be much appreciated!

[] little lean on groceries, could really use a pizza. i'm a student who's exhausted my semester fund, and my boyfriend's paycheck is lost somewhere in the mail. i'm hoping that someone could help us out tonight, as we've exhausted the pasta reserves in the pantry. thanks guys.
[][uk] i ate my pasta for lunch and now my only option for dinner is soup.. i'm scottish and obviously i love soup, but to me it's a lunch food. eating the pasta for lunch was really poor planning by myself, so anyone willing to donate me a proper dinner would be a hero.
[] today's my real life cake day and some pizza would be amazing.. today is my birthday, and i'm hungry. i'm a non-trad college student and a single mom. my daughter is at her dad's at the moment. 
i'm flat broke. i spent the very last of my money on food, but ramen and fish sticks aren't sounding very appetizing at the moment.
i have a code for 20% off at papa johns, btw.

[] hays, ks: do a bro a solid, it's rural out here. so i am a college kid who's carrying on a long distance relationship with a girl back from where i live in colorado. she is coming out to visit me this weekend (gets here friday night) and i'd love to have a nice pizza waiting for her after the 5 1/2 hour drive she has to make. unfortunately, in order for her to visit she has to stay in a hotel and we're splitting the cost (considering she paid for gas), meaning i do not have the extra money to buy a pizza. hook a brother up?

edit: as a reward, i will send the generous donor a mash-up of gangnam style, party rock anthem, like a g6, pretty fly (for a white guy), and bad touch that is no longer available for public download, but very well mixed and great to listen to.
[] so it's my week off.... and my first week off since january (aside from spring break). between a non-paid internship at a local newspaper, school, freelance work for bills, i find myself sitting here broke gaming on my computer for the first time in ages. the only thing that could make this better, is some pizza from a generous fellow redditor. reddit pls. 
[] congratulations! you've won the mexican national pizza lottery! i am the commissioner of prize claim. in order to receive your winnings, you must first wire over one pepperoni pizza as collateral. . i am actually in no longer commissioner, but now a broke college study whose last final is tomorrow.  i could really use a good pizza right now as all my money has gone to putting a down payment on a house and tuition for next semester. life's a garden, dig it.  
[] date night / family night. so i'm one of those people brought here by the recent media coverage.  i'm sorry if that makes me an outsider.  i've spent the last few days just reading through this site.  both the pizza end of things and other areas.  i had no idea about reddit.  this random acts of pizza is truly amazing to follow.  you laugh at the guy who's just bored and wants someone to send him a pizza, and you feel for the people that a pizza would be more than a pizza.  i've been hesitant to post because while i'm in a tough spot, it lacks in comparison to so many others.  i finally decided i'd just give it a try.  worse case scenario, i don't get a pizza.  that's where i am anyway :)

i've been married for almost 10 years.  my wife and i have two beautiful children, a daughter 5, and a son 6.  when i met my wife, i was working crazy hours and didn't always have time for everything we wanted, but friday night was always our date night.  it started purely by accident when she invited me over for pizza and a movie one night, and we've kept the tradition alive all these years.  we used to go out to the movies, and when that got too expensive, we enjoyed a movie at home.  when the kids got older, date night was expanded to family night.  pizza and a movie for everyone.  we've gone through a lot of things in the last few years.  it's often felt like one step forward and two steps back.  we're still moving though.  still fighting.  there came a point where pizza became a luxury, and it's something we've accepted and moved on.  i laugh when people talk about discretionary income.  we've learned to shave a lot of corners and given up a lot of things just to pay the bills.  

anyway, i guess my request is this.  i would love to, just for one night, be able to surprise the family with our pizza tradition.  they deserve it, and i wish i could give it to them.

i'm sure above me and below me are probably posts of people that need it more than we do, and i say give it to them.  if someone knows what it's like to be in this place and wants to help out, it would be much appreciated.

i look forward to the day i can come on here and make someone's day.  no promises of when i'll be able to do that, but i can promise it will happen, and i will be spreading the word about this and hope that more people will offer help to those who need it.

thanks for listening, and sorry for the long post.  
[] philadelphia, pa. poor intern wanting pizza.... just moved to conshohocken apartments in philly. i have had ramen for the last 4 days and i wont have money for stuff for a few weeks. it would be awesome if someone could pizza-me-up sometime. pm me and i can of course give you any info if you are interested in helping me out!

[] willing to do a random act for some pizza goodness. title pretty much says it all. no sob story or anything, just willing to do a random act to get some pizza
[] pittsburgh - totally broke from putting down a security deposit on a rental house, ramen just doesn't have that celebratory feel. things are very tight for me, and have been for a long time. but that's going to change soon :) as i'll be moving into a fantastic house in the heart of the city, with two lovely friends. my expenses will be halved, and i'll be closer to everything that's hapening :d 

i keep feeling this mix of anticipatory excitement and nauseating terror - it's clear that this is kind of a moment, like i'm closing a chapter on one part of my life and starting the next one. and i wanna celebrate with pizza, not with ramen or easy mac, which is all i'll have til payday on friday.

so really, i just want a greasy carb bomb to the gut, to properly honor this moment! thanks :)
[] life is too much for me and my family :( anyone willing to read my sob story? (thanks in advance) houston, texas. throwaway account, i have friends that are redditors

recently my wife lost her job, we have too many bills, my mother passed away due to diabetes and now i just got in a crash recently. i have a lot of bills but not enough money and my family suffers for that. a pizza would really help us cope with all this bs that life is throwing our way. i have a beautiful wife and a really awesome son who i love very much. i know begging is the last thing people want to do but i am at that level. i don't know what to do and i have barely enough money to cover all of this. i would really appreciate it if someone would gift us a pizza and i'm sure so would my family. the chances of me getting one are low but its still worth a try. god bless you for reading this and thank you. if by some miracle someone gifts us one then i would gladly repay the favor when i get back on my feet.
[] saint louis - would love a nice pizza tonight?. stuck at work until midnight - not much around to munch on. feel a bit guilty - ended up spending my pizza money helping out some people in /r/assistance. will gladly pizza it forward after the 28th. 
[] mississippi usa seeking a cheese pizza for whiskey (p4l). i was trying to come up with a drinking game with the little bit of whiskey i have left for this oscar night.  i suddenly thought, "self, a glorious cheese pizza would be a wonderful pairing with impending drunkenness."

[] charlotte nc; a truly broke graduating senior says: a pizza would really brighten my world. $0.33 in bank account, savings restricted due to online transfer limit being reached, and not getting payed for 10 days. i work and am in class constantly, but i barely make ends meet. this month is exceptionally bad for me and i haven't had constant access to food. any help would be appreciated!
[] a pizza would be nice!. i literally haven't eaten a meal since last friday night.. and the friends and family i have asked, have done so within the last month. i don't have money or food at home and i won't until next monday. i really hope someone will be kind enough to help me out! please message me.
[] pizza for 3 people.. we have used all of our food money for a month because me and my brother and friend just finished remodeling my brothers room because his room was ugly looking hahahah. and we dont get paid till monday and we were just wondering if any of you noble people of raop will give us something that will feed 3 hungry people! thank you :] if you are interested i will give you 3 dollars on the psn store for exchange.
[] recently fired mother of three. hey all, i have been a lurker for awhile now but decided to see if i could get a little help. my previous employer down-sized recently and fired many employees including me. i am a single mother with three children. i have no savings and have been able to support my childrens lives and my own from paycheck to paycheck. if anyone would be kind enough to help out with a gift card or anything, i would greatly appreciate it. it will help us more than you know.
[] i'm a college student who is very bad with money.... i spent all my money on booze for the next week without realizing the fact that i'd need food too... i'm a retard. so! a pizza would be much appreciated. :)

[] indiana usa
sleeping on couches, no money for food!. long story short: i got kicked out of my house for asking to take my computer to a lan party. (i am not exaggerating)

for the past couple weeks i have been staying with my dad &amp; his girlfriend, but yesterday i ran out of the money i had been saving. i don't get paid for another 2 days and i am absolutely famished.
[] 40 weeks, 6 days pregnant -- husband is at training until tomorrow night.. i don't even know if this is allowed, because i technically don't want pizza. i do want chocolate lava cake from dominos.


i was due with my husband and i's daughter last friday. the same day, i had to take my husband to the airport for a week of training. we tried so hard to get out of it, but that's the life in the military.

i honestly could get up and bake some cookies or something, but i am trying to stay in a reclined position. i'm trying to get my contractions to slow down until my husband gets home tomorrow night. 

[] pizza for a couple of young adults in union city, ca. first, i want to say wow! i had no idea something like this existed. i've helped people on the street with meals before but this is something beautifully different. 

i am a young woman living with my longtime boyfriend and like a lot of people, times are tough. i had a temporary lay off with my job that i just went back to but wont be receiving a paycheck until next friday. my boyfriend wont be paid from his work until the 6th. had dental work done recently that took about 190 bucks to fix my teeth. i used my last can of chili beans and mixed it with white rice last night for dinner. many nights we go without dinner(sometimes i survive on cups of coffee all day) but we never lose sight that things will get better for us eventually. we are in the middle class rut; don't make enough to survive comfortably in california but are making too much money for food assistance. it leaved us caught in a limbo. ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone. 

it seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as i don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me. i would love a pizza for dinner and with the leftovers, eat for breakfast and lunch. we live in union city, california in the shadows of both the great silicon valley and the san fransisco bay. right smack in the middle where apartments are tiny but cost you an arm and a leg to live there. 

thank you guys for taking the time to create such a wonderful service to help your fellow man. i will be paying it forward when i get on my feet, if only a simple pie to a struggling family. 

email me at l0serl0ve7@gmail.com if you could help us. if you need proof of something lemme know, i can screenshot my dentist check that cleared or my negative account balance. thanks again.

[] medical flight team stuck. the pilot, my partner, and i had to make a quick landing after one of our sensors started acting up. luckily we didn't have a patient with us. we're grounded at a small airport and were about to order some pizza. thought i'd see if a random pizza flew our way. thanks. 
() stoughton,wi. single mom of 4 and one on the way. money is running out and my kids deserve a treat (pizza) after all they have been through and then some! thank you! :-)
[] broke &amp; haven't had pizza since may. i did a summer abroad trip to europe this year. cool, right? i had to take out several private loans to cover expenses at home, like rent, while i was away. to make a long story short, my financial aid advisor boned me and only gave me above 66% of my private loan -- saying i had sufficient funds. i convinced my generous grandparents to loan me some money for my flight home. the cheapest i could find was a couple cities away. after eating nothing but bread and fruit the last several weeks and being couped up in this hostel all day i am finally going home tomorrow!!!! 

all i want is to go home and if i can get a nice american pie then thatd be great, too! it has been too long since ive had a pizza! i live in buffalo if that helps. 
[]forgot to bring my lunch to work. wpb, fl. too flippin hot outside to want to go anywhere (aka, i'm lazy). 
coworkers will be like "hey, where did you get the pizza?" and i'll be all like "yo, some bad ass mofo inside my computa bought this fo me"

or i could respond using proper english if you prefer. or i could dance a jig and put a slice on my head.

edit: and now its pouring outside so i really don't want to go anywhere.

[] student financial aid refund check late nc. i am a nursing student in south eastern north carolina. i am 29 years old, and i have 5 children. i was expecting to have my financial aid refund check this past week, but got an email last wednesday that because i had a class that started late, i will not get my check until the middle of july. we budget very carefully to have money for everything, and this has really put us in a bind. we do get food stamps, but because they changed the date of disbursement for july, we've had to really stretch our food budget to make it through until then. we won't starve without pizza, but it would be nice to treat my kids, since i had promised them we would go out for a nice dinner when my check came. i can, and will help someone out in a few weeks when i get my refund. thank you if anyone wants to help. :)
[] a recent college graduate down on life. i'm recently graduated college with a bs in mathematics and there is nothing i can find with it. i have no money and my link card has been shut down so i can't buy food. i have no money because i put everything i had into paying rent for october. at the end of october if i don't figure something out i'm toast. all i'm asking is for some pizza. i haven't eaten today and the last of my oatmeal ran out two days ago. 

if it matters i'm active in r/learnmath where i try to answer math questions related to combinatorics, probability, analysis, and calculus. 

if anybody decides to respond i have a verification code i can e-mail and i feel i would owe you eternally.
[] chesterfield, va hello, just discovered the community and thought i'd try. . to think such a community existed is simply an amazement to me. [my reaction upon discovering this wonderous place.](http://i.imgur.com/auxws.jpg) i'm in no special condition the deserved the need for pizza, i simply want a delicious pizza. my only means of transportation is the bicycle, so if it's delivery i can take care of the tip. thanks for the consideration, comrades. i wish you all a good day. 
[]  stuck at home alone, roommate flew out this morning, and i just got out of the hospital and need to eat.. just got out of the hospital, not anything major but i was there overnight.  my roommate left to work out of state this morning (left me an empty pantry and fridge), and the few friends i have here are busy.  parents are 2.5 hours away and that's way too long to wait for food.  can reddit help me out?
[] at work and hungry.. at work tonight in a hotel and none of us have enough cash to order a pizza or anything for that matter. we would really appreciate some free food to fill out empty hospitality worker tummies.
[] london, united kingdom could really go for a pizza... 
. my siblings and i are hungry for some pizza, we don't go out much and with our parent working all the time we never get to go out to eat much. so please if anyone can give us a pizza that would be awesome.
[] stuck in south dakota - school just processed a payment i made months ago. i have less than a hundred dollars, 300 miles to go, and a sad belly.. feels really strange to ask.. but, long story short, i went to visit friends this weekend up at sdsu in brookings, sd, and after checking my bank account, i saw a nice 900 dollar deduction... from a payment made in february.
i return back to lincoln, ne in a couple days, and i can make it gas wise.. but if someone can spare a 5 dollar pizza hut calzone or something, i'd love it. love. probably couldn't eat it, because i'd marry it.. but it'd just be an elaborate ploy to get to the rest of it's family.
if you can't give, words of encouragement are nice too. i can try to eat those.
[] just got dumped by the love of my life and i haven't eaten in the days.. somebody would brighten up my day a lot. we were engaged but he decided that he just didn't care anymore. i honestly hate asking for help, but i guess this is an exception. it's pretty loserly, but reddit has been one of the only things i have to get me through the day. 
[] hungry as hell. not much to say, super hungry and bored and i don't get paid until next week. if anyone wants to help a bro out it'd be legit.
[] san francisco college student needs a bad week to get better. hey guys! first time requester...long story short, my job hates me and my roomies are asshats. can anyone suggest a great way to end the evening?
[] i heard that the random button was a disaster waiting to happen.... but i was pleasantly surprised to click on it, only to find such a cool subreddit! i looked through the posts- there are a lot of sad stories, and a lot of pizzas mending some rough situations. while i don't have any such problems in my life, i do love both pizza and kindness, and i would be *elated* to be on the receiving side of such a great combo!

combo makes me think of pizza. mmmmmm.

i live in chicago, il, right next to clark and division, visiting my girlfriend (my home is in the bay area of california). i don't do evil things, try my best to smile every day, love black olives, and want to give a warm thank you to everyone who reads this!
[] garlic jim's is the shit!. not gonna lie, i could go and buy a pizza for myself and my kids (wife's out of town on business for the next couple of weeks) but i just found this and it's a pretty cool idea so i figured i'd give it a shot!

garlic jim's is a little on the pricy-er side, we usually get papa murphy's take'n'bake, but can't beat the garlicky goodness that is jim's!

thanks reddit!

[] family with no budget would love a pizza. unexpected dental work has tightened our family of four's budget this week and there's not much left to buy groceries. if anyone could spare a pizza, we would greatly appreciate it.

if anyone would be so kind i promise to pass it on once i am established again. thanks for reading.
[] poughkeepsie, new york; broke this week and would love a pizza today. i'm broke this week and just had enough money to get bills paid and i am extremely tight on food. most of what i have was a gift from my mother. a pizza would be extremely appreciated, and will be paid back in an offer-to-be. thanks for helping a girl out!

my friends and i are going to have a pizza party for the oscars tonight and i was going to use the free pizza i had saved for the coin toss. so i go on to the papa john's website to order my pizza to pick on the way to my friends house tonight but it tells me "the promo code you entered has exceeded the maximum allowed usage" but i haven't used it yet. i called customer service but i got a busy signal. after a few tries, i gave up. because it's my cake day and i love the oscars, i thought someone might have sympathy for me. 

but, if someone thinks i can get this fixed once i get a hold of customer service, i'll keep trying but i don't know how to prove i didn't already use it. i mean, my order history will be blank bc i created the account to use the code but other than that, i don't know what to tell them. if i can get this fixed then i won't need/accept an offer from you guys. 

edit: finally got through to customer service and we got it worked out. they gave me a new code. thanks to anyone who considered helping me out. i'll try to pizza someone in the future when i have the means. 
[] poor person + laid off person = hungry and profound | montreal. fact is, no food in house. we requested a local food bank provide some and have to wait several days. alas, empty stomach is now.

hundredthoughts of please and thank you.
[] i've been eating coffee grinds in prince albert, saskatchewan. i've been eating coffee grinds for the past few days. i'm out of town working, about 600km away, until thursday when i get paid. i would have been fine but i loaned a few thousand dollars to my parents and they couldn't pay me back when i had to go back to school for a few weeks. i spent the last of my money on medication and now i have 51 cents in the bank, luckily some bills bounced instead of overdrafting my account.

i don't know, if no one else needs help i would be grateful. 
[] [houston,tx ]the irs was supposed to give me my refund today and hasnt, my un-employed roomate still owes me money for the internet and hasnt paid, my dog is shitting all over the places and i dont know why.... and i just ate the last two eggs in my apt and now only have a can of chicken noodle soup,some potato wedges,minute rice and half a loaf of bread in my kitchen. i've been working my ass off for the past month but recently had to put 900 bucks into my car two weeks before my rent was due. after paying rent on the 1st i had 35 bucks to last me 10 days until pay day. i am now down to 7 bucks and i work tomorrow, thursday and friday. i have just over qtr of a tank left and my work is 12 miles from my apt, so i'm pretty much spending that 7 bucks on gas in hopes that it will get me enough to get to work. i have gotten pizzas on here before, and i've been lurking thru the threads this week trying to win a pizza but every time i'm to late. i know that raop gets these type of sob stories all day, and a lot of them arent rewarded so i'm not really putting to much hope into this. i just thought it would be nice to try and get a large pizza that i could munch on for a few days so i dont starve before pay day.
staying in []. been roaming around on this subreddit for awhile but didn't have any need to post. i'm not in any dire situation but wanted to see if anyone was feeling generous tonight. i go to ohio state, living right off of campus, and just haven't had time to get out to the grocery store this week. if anyone out there could help me out just for tonight it would make my night. thanks for taking the time to read, love what this place is about.









[] i feel bad for asking, but i've been craving some pizza like crazy (and my wallet says no!). it'll be another couple of weeks until my boyfriend gets his paycheck from his new job, and my income isn't really able to support two people so we've eaten a lot of rice and ramen lately. i've been craving pizza so bad that i've finally gotten the nerve to ask you fine folks to help a girl out (which makes me feel slightly less guilty than asking my parents for $20). 

i will definitely pay you back, or pay it forward if you prefer (probably both) as soon as i am able.

[] hungry, working towards my dream, kind of scared to ask for pizza though!. so... i don't really know how to request pizza, especially since what i have to ask for probably makes me sound really... un-needy. i'm 24, flew myself out to columbus ohio to work with cirque du soleil temporarily and only work four hours a day and we haven't gotten paid yet. i'm down to $100 and i use most of that to help get me to and from the cirque site and i haven't eaten anything except some bananas since yesterday. 

it's hard to ask for help, since i put myself here because i want to one day work for cirque du soleil -- instead of just a temporary job working with a show while they are in a city. i plan on trying to follow them for a few more shows and hope the experience helps set my resume apart, as well as that i can practice some aerial arts (trapeze).

i absolutely love the show and the people i am following and it's really the show i want to work for but if i were to actually land a job with cirque, i honestly would not mind any show.

regardless, gluten makes me very sick so pizza typically isn't something i can get unless i order multiple little domino's gluten free pizza. i don't really know who else delivers in the downtown columbus area that has gluten free, and also since it's 1am.

i don't expect pizza, since gf is such a hassle but thank you for having a subreddit like this exist.

[pseudo-] delivery driver shot: proceeds go to family of deceased. . a delivery driver was shot and killed while approaching someone stealing from coworkers cars: http://www.wthr.com/story/15957703/pizza-delivery-driver-shot-in-bloomington 
i've never been on this subreddit before but i figured this was appropriate to link, and since that location is offering all proceeds to go to the family of the deceased( http://www.facebook.com/pages/pizza-x/82904137667 ) i figured raop might be interested. there is nothing in it for me: i do not know the individual/family of the deceased, but i am from bloomington and felt like outreach might be appreciated by his surviving family.

() will be clever for food. mableton georgia. i don't have a canvas long enough to paint a vivid picture of my sob story, so i won't. instead, i devised a few riddles for you to have fun with. if you enjoy the challenge they present maybe you'll reward me with a gift card for my cleverness? it never hurts to try. so here you go, a few riddles to toy around with while you debate whether or not i deserve a hot meal today.

1.) what's 4 inches long but can house all of your buds?

2.) if i press hard enough i might strike a face that makes me a wealthier man. what am i?

3.) how many links are in the chain when it clinks?

4.) right now may not seem like spring at all, but i've got rainbows planned for tomorrow, and then all of these will belong to you.

5.) i had a cat i named him earl. i had a fish i named him pearl. but what should i name my bird of prey?

i hope you enjoyed my little challenge of wits, i'll post the answers later regardless of whether or not i receive a gift card. so best of luck and see how many you can get right. and if you feel like helping a guy a bit down on his luck eat tonight feel free to message me or post below. 

thanks again and remember, a mind is a terrible thing to waste, but it's even more terrible to waste a mind.
[] overtired (it's only monday!) pharmacy student who has three tests this week!. hey guys, i have never done this before so be nice to me! ;p

i'm in pharmacy school in north dakota (cst) and have three tests this week. i worked last week and weekend and again tomorrow and i am just tired. i have been surviving off of coffee ;p

it is getting about hungry time and i just feel too lazy to get up and make something vs. just order something. (i should be studying all of your renal transporters. ;x)the only downside of course is spending way more money ordering a pizza!

so, if anyone is interested, that would be awesome!

[] had to get my dog euthanized, unexpectedly. no food money until the 15th.. i could really use some help. i took my dog [volk](http://tinypic.com/r/241rqmf/7), he was 25% timber wolf 75% german sheperd, to the vet yesterday because he stopped eating and was generally acting really weird, not wanting to move. it had been getting worse over the course of last week. after the vet's initial examination, he thought it had something to do with volks kidneys, so i left him with the vet overnight. i got a call this morning from the vet's office, telling me that it was some congenital disease, that causes terminal kidney failure and that though i could probably keep him alive on dialysis for a while, it would be extremely expensive and he wouldn't be living a full, happy life. so, i went in this morning and said good-bye. 
anyway, the total cost of the visit, tests, and euthanasia was close to $300, all of which i had to pay up front. that was supposed to be grocery money. i feel bad asking for help from people i don't even know, but all my roommates and friends went home for the summer, and i promise i'll pay it forward.

i'm in dallas.

[] hungry kid in ky. i have a 7 year old son named isaac and we dont have anything to eat until friday when i get my check. we only a tiny thing of old leftovers in the fridge right now, just trying to make it a couple more days. if anyone could help us out til then i'd be so happy to pay it forward in 2 days, thank you all so much! 
[] a bit down on luck, thought i would finally give this a try.. ~~hi you guys. first i would like to say this thread and the people who frequent it are amazing. i've always been nervous to post here as i am usually too broke to reciprocate. i'm still broke, but when i get my tax return i definitely will reciprocate.~~

~~a little about me and why i'm posting: i live with my mom and work a minimum wage job in southern california. (north county)~~

~~we have a three bedroom house that the bank is trying to foreclose on. although this isn't a new situation for us, the guy who offered to do the home loan modification took two-thousand dollars of my and my mother's money and bailed. my mom's transmission also failed around last month so we've been taking the bus.~~

~~we have been able to manage lately, until recently when my sister and her husband declared they would not be paying my mom rent for staying here anymore, and i found out they had only been paying my mom seventy-five dollars each for the past four months. it has been a pretty big blow, albiet not surprising, and has now put an even greater strain on my mom and i.~~

~~as of yesterday sdge came through and shut off our electricity. (i am writing via phone.) the bill is just over six-hundred dollars past due (i just found out) and my mom has been calling around trying to find help. i know it is probably stupid to request a pizza in lieu of everything else but i thought it would be a nice change from everything else going on right now.~~

~~i know sob stories are probably cliche here, and my apologies for that. just figured i would give it a shot. if anyone is interested, i can also provide pictures of the sdge notice on the meter, or whatever else.~~

~~so yeah. that's it. thanks.~~

edit: overdrew the bank account to get the electricity back on, as it was needed for my mom. i downvoted my post, but just struck-out what i wrote so not to just simply delete as this board has advised against that.

[] &lt;3. i love pizza and have no means to get it. hoping someone understands the eternal craving for a pepperoni pie. i will pay it forward when i can (within the next week) &lt;3 thanks for reading

[] i am a student. i have no money. hyderabad, india. people owe me but are refusing to pay. i want to eat something real just one night. sorry for the desperation.
[] not for me, but for my family. i moved away from home a little over a year ago to be with my husband. i have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when i don't talk to at least one of my siblings via steam or facebook. i just missed an im from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. she was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. i feel awful about this, but i'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. making matters worse, i thoughtlessly made a comment on facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. how i must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.

their financial situation is complicated and i don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, i hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. i've been where they are, and i know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food. 

here's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago:

[] fresno, california - having a pretty rough day, incredibly broke, could really use not having to eat ramen tonight.. my fiancee and i have been spending all day organizing my father's house after he passed away a few weeks ago.  it's been a lot harder than i thought it would be.

we only have $2.27 in our bank account until i get paid on tuesday, and it would be really nice to not have to heat up another cup o' noodles tonight, and instead be able to relax and chow down on some deliciousness.

[] skipping meals so my family can eat (ks). so the situation is we've been running low on food the last couple of weeks and any cash we've had has been put immediately into the car for gas to get me back and forth to work in kc.  we have been cooking rice and canned things, but have not much left to last us the next few days.  so that my husband and daughter can eat full meals, i've been skipping breakfast and lunch this week and living on hot tea and chewing gum while at work.  

it's normally not a big deal, and i can make it through the day fine, but today i'm already super-hungry and it's not even 11 am yet.  i get paid on friday and will be able to re-stock our pantry then, but i am definitely feeling the empty hole in my tummy today.  i am thinking of going to jimmy john's and begging for a day-old loaf of bread if they have any.

if anybody could find it in their heart to buy me a pizza today, i would be very happy, and it could last me the next few days of lunch at work until i get my check friday afternoon.  i will even pay you back via paypal that evening after my check is deposited.


[] florida, would murder for a slice. . hey, everyone.

[] columbia, mo: i don't ask for this kinda thing often, but i kinda need a hand. hey ya, i am coming here to ask for a pizza if any one is feeling kind enough!  i'm pretty hungry and i have no buying power.  i am a very poor college student whos had it pretty rough in the past year and...  well, i'd enjoy a pizza very much.

[] 9 resumes sent out just today, not a penny to my name.  a nice pizza for the weekend would be appreciated.

() college student with no money, very hungry studying for midterm. my mom was recently in a car accident, and she's been having shoulder/neck/back problems that she has to get mri's done for and she has to visit her doctor frequently. my parents usually supply me with some money when they can, but i rejected their offer this time because their $20 copays are piling up and they barely have any food in the cupboards themselves, so they need the money much more than i do. this is my first post on here, and i realize there may be people that need food much more than i do, so please help them first. pizza would last me a few days. god bless. 
[] [appealing to emotions] money ran short this month and have to spend the next 4 days scrounging for food.. so its pretty much what i stated in my title. i'm a relatively poor college kid making a living on ebay buying/selling/refurbishing iphones and other electronics. this month didn't go so well and i don't have money until my next paypal payment is processed. (can provide proof of this)

in return i can fix/root/upgrade/whatever your cell phone or other personal electronic or draw you a really bad picture! i could also be your lane-mate in dota 2 (i play a mean omniknight)

if you can't give pizza an internet high five would also do the trick!

[] pizza for me and my boy. i don't normally ask for things from people, especially ones i don't know, but this subreddit seems pretty awesome..

my backstory:
i'm a 24 year old single dad with full custody of my 5 year old. things have been really tight for years..pretty much since i graduated high school. i pay for everything on my own and between rent, car payment, utilities, groceries, and a $440 daycare bill every month there isn't much left. his mother chips in $75/month which doesn't even pay for a week of daycare. 

anyway, my son starts elementary school next week and is scared to death. would love to surprise him with a pizza :]

since i won't be having that massive daycare bill next month i will gladly pay it forward!
[] gf of 5 years just broke up with me. low on money. pizza cheers me up. . this is my first time requesting for a pizza. pizzas always cheer me up no matter what the situation is. i hope i am doing this right.

[] lack of energy to cook today. pizza would be awesome.. **edit**: fark, i'm slow and forgot to post my location. i'm in virginia.

first of, happy labor day! i hope everyone has had an awesome day.

like the post says, i simply lack the energy today to cook. i tried taking effexor (an anti-depressant drug) and it didn't go well for me (lots of nausea and loss of appetite) so i decided to not take take it anymore. of course, going off of an anti-depressant makes you kind of moody and that's where i am now. 

so, i'm here in hopes that someone will toss a pizza my way.

[] homeless and jobless in stl, mo. hey everyone, my name is nick, i'm 23, had to drop out of college a year ago, and i'm currently living in a van in front of my friend's house. i lost my job and have been looking for a new one for about a month and a half now, so far, to no avail. i'm not asking for a pizza just for me to enjoy, but also for my friend who is helping me out a ton until i get back on my feet. i'm not starving and i have a safe place to sleep, thanks to his generosity. it's been quite a humbling and learning experience, and i'd like to be able to give him something back in return; i feel like pizza would be a great way to do that. i can't think of anything to do or give in exchange (but if you can, let me know), other than a poem written about whatever you want and the promise to pay it forward when things get better for me. thanks for your time!

[] . hi there, well i am kinda hesitant about asking but i think the stomach is winning the war over pride. long story short, had a roommate bail on me, owes me a bunch of monies. financial aid for summer didn't go so far when my expenses for roof/power/water almost doubled. hey but it's been great for aesthetics i've lost about 15 pounds since may. its also been great for teaching me how to be more frugal, and learned to accept charity ( thank you whatever is above for food pantrys). i am moving soon, back home for the fall but i am down to $60 which has to last two weeks, and half of which will have to go to gas. i am in las cruces, nm. . . have a code and such and a major hankering for some hot delicious pizza. extra karma bonus points if you get them to draw a pony on the box, preferably pinkie pie. . .
[] pizza for starving guy. i get paid at the end of the month,  the final week is always a struggle.  i could ration a pizza, if i had a pizza.

[] pizza for santa on christmas eve?. i know christmas eve is tomorrow, but i figured if i posted now this might be seen. here's the deal, i am a mom of 2 little ones (4 and 1). i will be doing all the santa duty tomorrow night: wrapping, stockings, putting together toys and trying to make it look like someone visited lol. my husband has to work so this will be the first year i am going solo.

[] london, uk  extremely poor, tired of butter sandwiches!. hey there, i am going hungry and would really appreciate a pizza from anyone willing. i'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (£9 to last until the end of august).

i went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. i hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (i'm quite shy, and very insecure).

for years now, i've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - i've always felt like i was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. around christmas, i did just that - sank like a stone. i fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what i can only describe as a mental breakdown over easter. i became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on sundays, and then i'd come home and get high again. obviously, i dropped out of university.

this, obviously, was a massive waste of money. it also didn't help that i'd lent one of my now ex-housemates £100 to help him pay his rent, which i know now that i will never see again (we live and learn). i have a £970 overdraft that is all gone, and although i've at least paid my rent for this month, i won't be getting paid until the end of august. i also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only £30 but too much for me) for the week before i enrolled, or i'll have a court date, and £40 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so i already owe her £500).

i've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all i can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). i'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.

i spend four hours commuting a day (i work in west london), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...i feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.

sorry for spilling this all out, i only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! i'm not known for being concise...

but yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, i can return the pizza favour once i get paid. i would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. thanks for listening &lt;3
[] i went to mexico with my band to play, ended up losing my wallet and had to wait 2 1/2 hours in secondary to cross back. pizza just sounds amazing at this point. first time playing tijuana, mexico earlier this week and i was a little sketched out. i didnt have a passport just my drivers license but i was told that would work. i made every precaution to play it safe, not taking it out and aware of my surroundings. when i placed my wallet in my jacket and set it next to my amp before i went on, someone grabbed it and it was nowhere to be found. had to pass through secondary which was a 2 1/2 wait and ended up calling my mom to bring my birth certificate over. i lost my credit card, my newly acquired license, debit card, spare car key, a couple gift cards, and my triple a car. waiting for friday to get paid, im living off pb and j sandwiches and right now pizza sounds great.
[] just got an a- on my midterm essay! illinois, usa. this is such an amazing day!
[] ft worth, tx - this sounds ambitious, but my god - pizza is delicious. hey there pizzaland! pizza would be pretty awesome right now. definitely don't need it, not starving or anything, but a nice pie is always tasty and would be a welcome treat from all the sandwiches i've been surviving on. i'm currently saving up all my money until after next pay day so i can go see my bff graduate bootcamp in san diego. i've been scrimping and saving to make this happen, so unfortunately pizza is just not in the budget right now.  

if anyone would make my night and send me a pizza pie - that would put me over the moon. i'll definitely return the deed in a few weeks once i have some extra spending money (august 9th).

may the pizza deities guide and protect you.

[] bradenton fl. i have only had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the past 9 days.. i'm on my own and have no family to speak of, i'm alone in florida and have $5.48 left to my name for gas to get to and from work. i lost my job due to downsizing but thankfully got a new one soon after - the only problem is they pay you bi weekly. i started on the 9th of this month and don't get my paycheck until this thursday - the 26th. i only have enough bread left to have one sandwich a day until then. i want nothing more right now than a domino's philly cheese steak pizza and a 20oz bottle of cherry coke and i swear to celebrate my first paycheck by giving someone else a pizza as soon as i can. please help me before i start to cry strawberry jelly.

i am mid 30's, hub is in his 40's. 

we rely on one another to get things as a team, but the last two days, my knee has been "out" and his back has been "out" and our grocery trip relies on us walking a half mile to the local walmart neighborhood grocery store, filling up backpacks and a large rolling suitcase, and walking home with them. 


we have to do our month's shopping all at once because we are on the stamps and to break it up into smaller trips wouldn't allow the money to stretch.


we have an offer for a ride to the store tomorrow, but we've been eating once a day for a week and ran out of food yesterday.

please pm me if you can help. willing to answer any questions.

[]pizza for 2 adults. i posted in the other subreddit but though i'd try here too. 

hi reddit. this is my first time ever doing something like this but here i go.

i am requesting a pizza to feed two adults in westminster md. my fiancé and i are behind because i broke my ankle in july and have been out of work since because the break required extensive surgery. all pizza chains are equally distant and would require us to pick up.

my fiancé doesn't get paid until next friday and his parents can only help so much, mostly with money for utilities and prescriptions for both of us. we have maybe $20 to our name and he has a full work schedule next week as well as having to take me to a follow up appointment with my surgeon on monday, who is located a thirty minute drive away.

we've been eating a lot of pbjs and ramen and our ramen is running out so a pizza could really help out a lot. when we have gotten two pizzas in the past,they have lasted us for three-four days.

thanks for your consideration and time reading this.

eta : i do have a verification code for this sub. :)


(first ) i haven't eaten in almost two days, i get paid tomorrow, and i'm getting so desperate.. some unexpected medical bills came up and i ended up completely broke.  i haven't eaten since tuesday morning and i can't describe how hungry i am.  if someone, anyone, can help me out today i would be eternally in your debt.

[] broke, unemployed, recently single. some random pizza would markedly improve my life right now. (seattle, wa). just what the title says. low on cash, unscheduled from my job, and my girlfriend left me, all within a couple weeks of one another. i've been struggling through job and internship applications, and trying to keep my head up, but it's not going great. my sleep and eating schedules have taken a dive as a result. not to speak of my mood, most of the time. i'm not starving or anything, but it's a pretty rough situation.

if any kindly redditor would be willing to send a pizza my way (it'd be dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow), i'd be very grateful, and promise to pay it forward the moment i can afford to do so. if not, that's okay - someone on here probably needs it more than me.

[] feed a hungry physics student and his daughter. hi everyone! i'm a physics grad student with a 6 year old daughter who want some pizza. we live in albany, ca (next to berkeley). we don't have any money because my soon-to-be ex-wife (daughter's mother) is sick (multiple sclerosis) and can't work. bank of america stopped paying her disability pay back in january and my research stipend isn't even enough to cover our rent. so my choices are top ramen, peanut butter and jelly *again*, or a random act of pizza. 

her mom is busy being fed at restaurants by her new boyfriend while we're here in the apartment struggling to get by. so some pizza would really hit the spot right about now.

your kindness will be greatly appreciated.
{} i've had a rubbish day and need cheering up please reddit. so i'm pretty broke this month and just heard from work that i wont be needed for a few weeks meaning that i don't have any money coming in for a while. i heard this after getting back from a full day in uni and with a few hours of reading to do tonight so i would really appreciate some pizza. in return i will pay the favour forward when i get money again and send the redditor who makes me smile a story of some kind or photos of me looking happy :) please help me random knights of the internet.

[][uk] trapped in our arguing friend's house and we're stoned and hungry.. hello reddit,

here's our story.

we're at a friend's house in (essentially) the middle of nowhere. we've come down to stay for a few days, and none of us have cars, so we're essentially stuck food free.

now, here's the tricky part. the two people we are staying with are currently having 'a relationship tiff'. essentially they've left us downstairs, post several joints, and we have absolutely no food, and a tremendous, burning desire for it.

we're sat desperately hoping they aren't breaking up, as this would be seriously uncool whilst high, and it would firmly delay our chance to eat pizza.

thank you.

long shot, but here goes.

i'm unemployed and going through a divorce. aside from cheating on me she spent all my money and what little i had left went straight to the divorce. i'm down to my last $35.00-----period. this is after selling everything i have that i don't still owe money on. i literally own nothing else but clothes, computer, car, and a dryer. my friends and family have already helped far too much and i'd hate to ask for more favors. i'm all out of groceries and won't begin to collect unemployment for another week or two. i didn't eat at all yesterday. 

i was wondering if there was someone out there who would be kind enough to feed me today. i don't care what size or whats on it, i just need something to eat.

my girlfriend, **muchtothedutch**, and i both recently got jobs after three months of being unemployed new arrivals to austin. this is awesome,but we started our jobs the 27th of june and we got paid through the 30th. this basically meant that we had just barely enough to cover our rent and bills. we've been living off rice, beans, ramen, and pasta for the last 10 or 11 days and we have to stretch it until next monday when we get paid.  we haven't even been eating lunch; it's down to a meal a day at this point.

if some awesome person could hook us up with a pizza tonight, it would completely make our day. we'll pay it back two fold come monday and post a follow up thread that day too.

thanks,

[][usa] mom and grandfather in the hospital, sister at a soccer game, dad has work and has to visit two different hospitals, cant leave the house, no money, no food.. **edit: never mind! since we couldn't hang out, my girlfriend made me and delivered dinner! here's my sob story anyway**

i never really did this before so i'm not sure how it works, and from the looks of how many people are posting and asking for pizza, i probably wont get any, but it's worth a go. my grandfather has been in the hospital for a week and my mom just went in this morning because she has pneumonia. my dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. he came home for a half hour and he said i can't leave the house because i have sats tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. when he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. i just checked my wallet and i remembered i just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on steam last night and i'm kind of regretting that now. now i'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. no matter what time he gets home, i still wont be able to eat. so all i'm asking for is a small pizza for one so i can eat tonight.

tl;dr: grandpa and my mom are in the hospital. my dad drove my sister to her soccer game then has to visit two different hospitals before going back to work. home alone. can't buy pizza because i bought a game last night with the last of my money.

[] out of food until friday dover, de. i thought i had planned a bit better for my family, but i wasn't able to stretch this last check as far. the wife and i have been fighting to pay medical bills with no end in sight. my wife has been in remission from cancer for 3 months. we're both staying hopeful that she have defeated this. i don't know what i would do if i lost my wife. she has been the love of my life for 15 years and we are still going strong. i feel that i've let her down as a man because we have never gone without food. this is probably one of the lowest moments of my life, but i have to ask for help. i asked my brother if he could loan me a little cash until friday but he's in just as bad of a situation as i am. i found a food pantry but it's too far away and no one at this location was willing to meet me halfway. i am hoping that someone out there can help my family and i. please consider us. thank you.

[] a pizza for new zealand?. i'm happy to sing for my supper, here's my story so far in handy bullet points:

* moved to another city to stay with a friend who assured me i could stay until i found a job

* friend changed their mind after two weeks and kicked me out

* managed to find a room in the house of a friend of my parents 

* paying $150 a week, no income, is supposed to include food but no food in the house

* to top it all off i'm still unemployed!

so yeah, after paying for food there is nothing to eat. there's no internet here (my smartphone is my saviour) and my email inbox is full of rejections from jobs i've applied to. even the local supermarkets aren't hiring!

i would definitely appreciate some cheering up in the form of a pizza if any redditor felt like helping me out :)

i've been a long time lurker of your fuu memes through my friend's links. i'm reaching out to you since i  moved to nyc this summer to start grad school and can barely afford living here, let alone cover my expenses. i've been living off ramen noodles and pb&amp;j sandwiches for the past 2 months and could really use a pick me up.

[] poor unemployed post-grad, in need of a meal. canadian post-grad here, i don't really want to get into too much detail about myself suffice to say that i have bills racked up that i need to pay and no job to pay for them, increasingly falling into debt and i know it's crazy but i've been prioritizing paying down my student loans than feeding myself. i'm not sure how much longer i can go on like this, i've lost a lot of weight over the past few months and things just keep getting worse. if my father was still alive i'm sure i wouldn't need to ask for this help, but in the current financial state my mother is in i cannot ask her for help (she would help me, but then she would have nothing to eat, maybe even lose her house).

i feel disgusted with myself that it has come to this, my self esteem isn't usually this low but with everything the way it is, it's hard to feel good about myself.

[] i live with a food-thief, and i'm either going to eat my curtains, or him.. hello, people. 

i was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. i've taken part in pizza sharing things before, i just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. my favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and hilarious tale involving calling the _mayor_ even, and i'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.

anyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.

basically i live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest uk, and this guy i share my space with is a presumptuous ass. it's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks i'm not in or asleep. 
that happened tonight. i come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, i'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight i get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! he basically used _everything_ i had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. one pointless shouting match later i'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that i'd happily eat my bed. spoke with the family i _just_ came from about this and i'm invited back over for dinner on friday, the day prior to my payday. still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. i already said that. um.

i've no idea of etiquette here, i've no idea if i said too little or not enough, but hey there's my request. i will say though that i'm probably gonna stick around here, and will definitely pass on the favour to somebody elses request once i'm paid. share the love and such.

hi. 35/f, love long walks on the beach, wishes for world peace, etc.    

i'm about another month of being poor away from my goal weight but food would be awesome too. not sure how this works. just looking for a small pizza (i think that would probably get me a couple of meals) and maybe a soda? my concern though is that i don't have enough cash to tip the driver for delivery and i think carry out has ended. do these deals work somehow with tip included? if not, i think i would rather pass than not tip.    

i get paid friday so hoping to pay it forward then.

[] i forgot my wallet and would like a sandwich from dominos in [pdx, or]. hello,

yesterday i went to get groceries and i switch to small bag purse. now my wallet is in the small bag purse. in my wallet it has my id so i can't get money at a bank. today is payday and i do have money but no access to it.i am too afraid to ask my coworkers to borrow money as i am a student worker so my coworkers are all my supervisors.  i work at 8am everyday and i skip breakfast. i don't want to be greedy and get a whole pizza so that is why i am asking for a sandwich.

you can check my account, i have send strangers random cards to try to pay it forward.

edit: i didn't get anything but that is okay. i get off work in a hour and i can go home and finally eat something.
first time ing - throwaway acct. wife &amp; i are splitting up for good, she has gone for the weekend to spend time with some of her family for a bit.  using a throwaway because we haven't notified most of our friends &amp; family yet of our situation, and i know a few people know my primary reedit account.  it's an amicable split, but that doesn't make it instantly easy, either.

that all being said, it's not only rough emotionally, but selling a house is rough (especially with the nature of the economy and us not being at a point where we were expecting to sell).

i could probably spare the $10 for a small or medium pizza, but i'm *really* trying to save every penny to help with all the costs.  plus, right now, a lot of things just feel like it sucks.  a little more right now since i'm in this house by myself.

if anyone thinks i'm a troll/scammer, i'd be happy to give you the name of my primary reddit name in private and verify through there and/or through the verification system.

fyi, i'm in the u.s., if that matters to anyone.

thanks, guys and gals.
[] magnolia, texas. lost my job and hit by a car while on my motorcycle in the same day. . so i had a phenomenal day on friday, i have to tell you all about it. 

i went into work and was called into the office of the manager who runs the whole establishment, mind you i've never even spoken to the man. he begins grilling me about some sensitive information i had leaked and wants to know how i found out. i have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.

what was the information? well i asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow i did.

how did i find this information out? a random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.

nothing fishy in the whole thing. i was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, i'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and i couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. so just like that i got the hammer.

i somehow took the news alright. i mean, i was definitely plotting my revenge on "the man" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.

i drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and i found myself underneath a 2006 dodge charger. 

the driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.

so now we're at the present moment. i'm on my 5th day of leg elevated bed lock down, the bills are still coming in, and the hunger is rumbling. i heard about this subreddit and thought i'd give it a shot. even if i there's no pizza to be had it was nice to tell the story. i hope you enjoyed it and thanks in advance for filling a crippled mans tummy! hahaha

[] 3 year old daughter s pizza. i've never done this before, sorry if i'm breaking some rules, though i'm pretty sure i got it all correct.

my 3 year old daughter never really asks for specific meals, so i was surprised that she asked for pizza this morning. i've already done our shopping, and i don't have the supplies to make any, and our food budget is depleted.  

anyone out there feel like making a family's night? we're a family of four, though the little one is only 16 months old, so he doesn't eat that much :-)

got a verification code if that is required.

() honeymoon and our hotel made an error leaving us without dinner.. we are on our honeymoon in virginia beach and unfortunately the quality inn we stayed at our first few nights managed to double bill us leaving us broke until tomorrow.  we would love a pizza or really anything we aren't picky.  i will reciprocate once my funds go in if you'd like or simply pay it forward.
[] east lansing, mi - two broke brothers wishing to feast on some tasty pizza tonight.. we're really hungry. both of us are in college, and had a few bills to pay that are preventing us from eating anything other than cheezits and goldfish. i like both of those things, but i don't really feel like making a meal out of them. it makes me cringe thinking about it actually. 

anyway, we're trying to watch the new game of thrones tonight and we both agree a pizza is in order. 

hope you can help us out!

edit: i don't know if any of you have seen this video, but it pretty much sums up our desires. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wusgil3v044

() family in ms could use a little lift. edit: i have been offered pizza for my family, thank you so much!!!

i'm really not sure how to do this, i've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.

my husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the "world" to get him in the door. this hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. we made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. he's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. no, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.

i applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. they said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. they said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. well, i haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until monday. i spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.

anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. my husband is a truck driver and i'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.

we are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. yes, i know that i am new. i cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, i can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. we are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else i'd have to use the library in town.

i'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. we are rural, they don't deliver out here. there is a pizza hut, dominos and a hunts brothers in a local country diner.

i want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will not starve tonight if they don't get pizza. we have a few odds and ends and i would never, ever let them starve. i'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. i'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on tuesday.

i'm not sure what kind of proof i could give? his checks are direct deposited with no stubs mailed yet. let me know what i need, i can try to figure out something to prove if requred.
[] wa usa, would like a celebratory slice while working on finals.. not unusual around here, i take it -- but i'm an unemployed and pretty damned broke college student, and i'd really, really like some pizza while working on my last final projects. beans and rice just lack a certain something.
[] dallas tx: super stressful day. tomorrow i have a pretty stressful day ahead of me. i've got to do tons of calling and mailing and application filling out to do in order to drop one school and enroll in another. i'm pretty terrible at handling stress too so a pizza would be a perfect way to unwind after it all. any from the big 3 would be fine, but pizza hut is my favorite!

i started going to school to get my life back on track, but unfortunately my alarm didn't go off a couple times and i lost my job.

used up my food stamp card and it doesn't refill until the 5th of august.

only got a couple packets of ramen left.  normally ramen is fine, but whenever i eat them only i only seem to have a bare minimum of energy, and i have a test tomorrow... i really can't fail this class.

i've ordered pizzas for people and bought people games on steam before, but no one's ever given me hand.

got a job interview soon, and every time i get an interview i get the job, so money flow will happen soon and i will pay you back.

[] bronx, new york decided to quit heroin yesterday, i think tonight i'll be able to eat again (with a little help!). so i've been descending the winding staircase of heroin addiction over the past couple months, but i've finally taken steps to save myself from myself. i deleted my dealers numbers and got a withdrawal survival kit going (water, toilet paper, and some bud) but between that and my debts from using i'm flat broke. it didn't matter yesterday since between the puking and shitting i didnt exactly have time to eat, but now i feel like i can finally stomach something. i'm suffering through a day at work right now but i get home around 7, and there's a dominoes down the road...im through getting high with a lil help from my friends, but can anyone help me get by? i sincerely thank anyone who even considers helping me out, you (hopefully) have no idea how alone i feel dealing with this self inflicted hell 

edit: one more thing, on the off chance anyone end up wanting to help either tonight or tomorrow afternoon, my doorbell doesnt work so if possible tell the delivery dude to give a quick shout at the 2nd floor front window, trust me ill be lying right there in bed the whole time. or, if its easier, i can pm my philanthropist hero my cell number so the delivery guy/gal can just call me
[] mid, mi - from my 6 year old daughter and i. it's a cold and rainy week. would like to have a pizza party. we can try to repay with artwork, pictures of our cat, and/or good deeds.. school is back up. just getting over being sick, with whatever public school kids are brewing this year. going to be a rainy week. finally getting my daughter back again for a little bit after a long week at her moms. already have some movies picked out. was thinking of throwing a little pizza party for her. we can try to repay with artwork, pictures of our cat -- (he is stunning), and/or good deeds.


daughter has been getting on here now that she reads pretty well, and was going to post from her account but it's less than a month and was too new. even though she mostly just likes to get on here and upvote pictures from /r/owls. she's loving karma, but... getting pizza'd on here would totally blow her mind. personally, i could use seeing something nice from the world. anyway, many thanks to any kind strangers that might come our way.

{} denver, co. single father trying to make it through the day. hey redditors,

i'll be upfront, this is a throwaway account.  i've got a little too much pride still to let people really know how bad of a situation i'm in.

to be blunt, my life sucks right now.  my wife left me about a year ago, the woman i've been seeing is now with one of my closest friends, i just lost my job 4 months ago, and the temp work just isn't out there.

the high point of my life right now is my little boy.  he's the best thing to come out of my marriage, i would do anything in the world for him.

this is why i'm coming to you reddit.  my wife is bringing him back tomorrow, and i would love to be able to surprise him with some pizza.  the sad fact is though, i can't afford it.  which is why i'm coming to you guys.  

i've seen some amazing generosity on here in the past few days, and was wondering if i would be lucky enough to get some too.


[]hungry for the past 3 days, with no food in site, please read. i saw random acts of pizza on abc news, and i have been lurking all day reading about all of the wonderful things this reddit has done. i just signed up today to be apart of this, and sad to say the first thing i will be doing is requesting. i haven't ate anything but a bagel in the last 3 days, and my paycheck comes in on friday, i am so hungry so if anyone would please help me out i will be sure to buy a pizza for someone in need when my check comes in

thank you reddit for listening
() just paid  my outragous teco bill, now im to broke for dinner (fl). i just paid my unexceptedly high teco bill that turned our grocery budge into a kool-aid and raman noodles budget. pizza for me and my son would be greatly appreciated 
[] car broke down and spent food money on repairs. getting paid tomorrow, and willing to return favor.. nothing super depressing, just poor timing. my car broke down two days ago, and i had to use my grocery money to fix it. i've been living on the pasta i had left, but i cooked the last of it earlier for lunch. i get paid tomorrow and would be more than willing to send pizza back to someone in thanks, but it might be nice to have a bit of dinner tonight if possible. i have a verification code ready and waiting as well, if that helps.
if someone should be so generous, i don't need anything fancy. it's just me here. a one topping large from pizza hut (are they still doing the large one toppings for 10 bucks?) would be perfect since ph is pretty close.
[] pizza for dinner tonight?. me and the fam damily would love some pizza for supper tonight, so i figured hell, let's give it a go :-)
[] lake mary is cold right now, feels kinda like home. pizza would be awesome.. been in kind of a slump lately, really missing home (maryland). florida is particularly chilly tonight, and is really driving the homesickness further. pizza would be great. i didn't just finish my finals, or break up with my girlfriend. i have some food in the fridge.. pizza would just be really nice right now. but of course, there are plenty of hungry redditors out there. take care of those guys, and let me know if there's any pizza love left.

thanks for being reddit 
[] i am muslim, so i am currently fasting. we get to break our fast in one hour at sundown (cooper city, fl). i am starving, so a cheese pizza from papa john's, pizza hut, or dominos will be appreciated.. 
[] uk-south west, just another poor student.. hey all, i love the stories i read on this subreddit of all you generous people, so here i am throwing myself upon your generosity.

my bank balance is looking decidedly negative, after shelling out money this last week for both my sisters upcoming birthday and mother's day.

about the only food i have at the moment is pasta, which i can eat if necessary, but i really fancy some pizza.

i have both a dominos and pizza hut nearby.

[] car broke, no food at house and starving in arizona!. hey guys so my jetta's engine light came on today and i can't get my car into the shop until tomorrow. my roomie and i meant to go grocery shopping today, but now that i'm carless we don't have a way to get there :( if anyone has a a coupon to a dominoes or any other pizza place we would really appreciate it if someone sent a pizza our way! i would normally just buy the pizza, but i'm going to need all the money i can get to fix this bitch. i feel bad if someone has to buy a pizza, so if someone has a free pizza coupon please send a pm my way and we will forever be in debt to you :)

tl;dr: two college students in arizona are starving and without a car. looking for a free pizza coupon if they exist!

p.s. i can post a picture of my cars engine light at request.
[] i spent a ton on birthday gifts last night, got laid off today. pizza.. please.. i've been working at an italian joint in north/ western michigan over the summer.. they sell pizza but i never ate there due to unsanitary and poor working conditions. today i went in for my shift and i'd been completely taken off the schedule, without any warning. what a bummer! and last night i spent a few hundred dollars on my boyfriend's birthday presents.
 i'm working on a scrapbook for him now, while singing gimme pizza.. slow.

thanks for reading.
[] just found out that i'm receiving 0 financial aid from my university and i just paid rent leaving no money. would love some pizza to cope.. after a lengthy conversation with my financial aid office, i have found out i will be receiving little to no benefit whatsoever from my school that aren't loans (this is actually a pretty big deal for me, personally) and for the summer i have no access to loans so i'm without any money after rent goes through. some pizza would be **damn** good right about now. i'm in irvine, ca if someone would be so kind :)
[] stoned and broke until getting paid tomorrow. i work as a valet and normally get the majority of my money in cash tips.  just moved to a new state and they don't have my bank and so i haven't been able to deposit my pay checks until tomorrow when i work again and get tip money for food.  if you feed me i will dedicate the rest of my afternoon to something productive, also known as rereading mario puzo's classic 1969 american crime masterpiece, the godfather.
() depressed mom could use a pizza.. boyfriend left my son and me and took all our money and the car. pizza sounds good. can how proof if needed buddykeiko@hotmail.com is my e-mail
[] emotionally blackmailed by "trusted friends" and it hurts. i could really use some comfort food.. my wallet and my stomach are empty, and i'm in california.. i'll spare the juicy personal details, but i lost a group of friends and a boyfriend because someone thought it would be fun to tell them all horrible, ridiculous lies about me. i really liked all of them, and took a huge risk trusting these people because i thought they were good people. (i'm a child abuse survivor, so i have a real hard time opening up.) i also put in a lot of energy (made gifts, gave encouragement, helped calm down anxiety attacks...)

the good news is, if they're that quick to turn on me based on someone's false information, i don't want them in my life anyway. they never asked me if it was true, just took it as fact. that's not a "friend" in my book.

the bad news is, it obviously hurts really, really bad. i'm doing the best i can to not fall apart. it's really hard to stop thinking about everything that happened. i feel like i stepped on a landmine, everything blew up in my face. i really want to watch a movie and eat some pizza and forget about all this drama for a bit. (i'm broke, so anything not eaten tonight will help sustain me until payday!) 

a gesture of kindness in the form of a pizza or even an inspiring message would mean so much to me right now.

on a side note, pizza or no pizza, this subreddit is a great reminder that there are still kind people in the world.

[]living alone and in abject poverty. i'm sitting at home contemplating eating a tunafish and ketchup sandwich because that's all i have left in my pantry.  i work at a restaurant where i make 9.75 an hour but i'm currently barely paying for my rent (which includes my gas and water bills). i just paid rent on the 7th after having scrapped together the tips i make off the grill i work to pay for rent.  i've got a total of 2.71 in my bank account and i don't get paid until next tuesday.  i've got the next 2 days off and while i will be able to buy some food saturday with my grill tips i only usually make about $15 bucks after a 6 hour shift.

() athens, ga - college student in a bind - will pay forward. edit: cayucoskid was kind enough to buy me a couple pizzas, they just showed up and not only taste amazing, but will feed me for the rest of the weekend. thank you so much.

so, my roommate had told me about this reddit, and i had planned to keep it in mind to give other people pizza every once in a while. i wasn't planning on using this for me...but i'm in a really tough situation right now. 
a little background: i had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when i lost my dining hall job. i managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is "always hiring" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food. i've been surviving off the kindness of my landlord/roommates, (i do dishes i don't have to pay for food) but that can only go so far. i'm attempting to go back to school so i don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and i haven't been getting the best hours. 
according to the government i make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for pell grant. my car has been spazzing out and i think it's probably on it's last legs, and today i didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so i don't get any bonuses.
overall everything's just been a bit rough, i definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as i get everything together. one of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and i'll be able to cover everything then.
it's just been a really rough day and i could use a meal that i didn't have to cook myself today.

[] flooded out in wash, dc, could use some pizza. recently my basement apartment was completely flooded. it took all my sheets and towels to dry the place out. so i spent the day and, what to me, is a fortune at the coin laundry. so there was no money for groceries. today i finished off the last food, and my monthly stipend does not arrive until the day after tomorrow. i could really use a pizza.
[] columbia, sc. i am the mom of 4 children and the wife of a wonderful husband.  some background info: my husband was in an auto accident on 8/14 and when he was finally able to return to work 9/7, he was told there is not enough work for him and that he should look for a new job.  this after he was working 55-60 hours a week before the accident (he was a passenger).  we went through our savings during his time out and have overdrawn our netspend account over $90.  our family has been living off of boxed mashed potatoes and the cheap boxed mac and cheese.  i have used the food bank already this month and i am waiting on dss to approve my food stamp app.  i am trying to do everything right.
it is 4:55 and every kid (ages 15, 13, 13 and 7) has all been asking about dinner.  they know their dad lost his job but they don't know about our financial situation of not only being broke but being negative in the bank.  
i am not worried about myself or my husband eating.  i would just really like for my children to have a filling dinner.  we have no bread, no milk, no meat.  just one cheese and one pepperoni pizza would mean more to my family than i can express.  i know we will be back on our feet within a month.  i have faith in that.  i am a strong believer in paying it forward.  any info or verification you need, please don't hesitate to ask.  i do have a verification code if someone is willing to help.
thank you for taking the time to read and consider my request.  this is very humbling but i want to put my pride away in hopes of my family having a filling meal tonight.

[] nc - my 8 month job search is finally over and i'd love some pizza to celebrate. after getting what had to be hundreds of "we're sorry" letters (and that's only the places that bothered to reply) i've finally run the gamut of interviews and got an offer!  i've been stretching my pennies quite far throughout this process, but the job is in another part of the country and i need to make sure i have enough scratch to make the trip.  

i'd love to be able to celebrate a bit and have some tasty pizza, and i look forward to being able to pay it forward before the end of the month. (i start the 22nd)

i have the big three close to me, and anything would make me so grateful!  thanks for reading, and good luck to other job-seekers out there - it can seem like it's futile, but just keep at it!

[] after a long day of moving. dammit, i forgot the location. i'm sorry! location is **st. john's, nl, canada**

today, i moved. i spent the past 2 hours throwing boxes and a bed onto a truck, dragging that across the city, and then hurling it into a new bedroom. it has been 27 degrees here in st. john's (80f) and the humidity isn't exactly being kind either. i've already taken a shower. i feel like a new one.

i could make food, i'm not going to lie. i've got boneless/skinless chicken breasts downstairs, i've got pasta and sauces, i've got marshmallows. however, i'd really just like to kick up on canada day, relax, and munch on some pizza. can provide any proof you'd like.

[] car issues, freezing cold and a empty wallet. . hello!!! 

i've heard great things about this subreddit and was hoping someone would help me out. 

had my hours cut at work, got paid last week only to spend it all by sunday catching up on bills.  had to pay for car insurance or else my license would have been suspended ( almost reached day 30)  because i wasn't made aware i lost my insurance ( parents always took care of it). and now the car's engine won't even kick over. 

stomach is growling and i have nothing but dry cereal ( which is something some people can't say i know. )  so i'm hoping one of you kind people will help me fill my belly. 

i promise to pay it forward x2 this pay check (1st of february) and will make sure my benefactor receives confirmation if desired. 

please and thank you you magnificent internet type people.

edit- an empty wallet :(

:/ 

long story short: went back to school and had to work shitty retail gig part time, barely making ends. now outta cash, but just started sweet new job. kind of getting by, barely, due to great friends.

 i think this is a nice idea, i'd definitely pay it forward when i get paid. ask when you need, give when you can...right? thanks if you can, no worries if you can't :)

[] willis, texas is down for some pizza.. ive got that pizza craving again, please help my suffering.

[] had to put my dog down today. broke could really use a pizza. melbourne, australia.. 
[] sweden. would like to feel a little luxury today.. no sob story, no special circumstances. would just like a pizza tonight instead of boring, cold food. 

will give in return when my pay check arrives at the end of the week!
[]stuck 8 hours from home with no money. long story short, i came to a retreat, and could not stay due to health problems. i am now stuck pretty far from home with no ride until tomorrow, and i spent what little money i had on a hotel. im really in need of something to eat, and will gladly pay it forward when i get home and have the chance.
[] pizza for dinner later tonight uk/scotland. my mother is away on holiday for 5 days. don't want to sound like she abandoned me or anything, i was happy to stay and watch our dogs. the only thing is, she didn't leave me money, instead she actually bought food at supermarket for me. she didn't realize though that the food she had left me wouldn't last the entire weekend because its now out of date. not her fault if anything probably mine since i already ate the food that wouldn't be out of date on thursday and friday and left the now out of date food (stupid i know) and now i got no food or money until tuesday. all i would be looking for is a plain margarita pizza.

it would be absolutely amazing if someone was to buy me a pizza for my dinner later tonight!
[] pizza, it's delicious.. pizza is delicious, this is a simple fact.  i would totally order myself a pizza, but that costs money, which unfortunately i don't have.  (i also don't have the best grasp of grammar apparently).  guelph, ontario is my location.  sorry i missed that in the side bar!

[] tucson. i would greatly appreciate any kind stranger willing to give pizza to a poor college kid.. i don't have a sob story. i just have no money and would like to eat something other than ramen tonight. if someone could find it in their hearts to send some pizza love, i will send internet love back to you.
[] miami. stuck at home with a broken car, would love a pizza.. pretty much what the title says. i was on my way out to find something cheap to eat when i found out my car's engine doesn't start, and so i turn to reddit for help in my time of hunger.

*~~* colorado mom of 2 spent last of money on baby formula!. i am a mother of two a 3 yr old and a 5 month old we are in tough times living at my mothers house trying to find a place to live. i am a stay at home mother while my fiancee works a full time minimum wage job to try to scrape by. due to the past few tough weeks my mother has decided that we have to leave by the beginning of august. i have just spent the last of our food stamps and money on our baby boy to buy him formula.  we are broke stressed out and in need of someone to raise our spirits. 
[] broke college student in tipp city, ohio.. guys, even though i work two jobs and go to school full time money is always tight and sometimes i run out. this week is one of those times. i havent had anything to eat today except for a couple of snacks i could scrounge from a friend's house. any way someone could help a fellow out?
[] low on cash this month, would love a pizza in denver.. i know this is second time i requested on here, but unfortunately no such luck, so i thought i'd try again. like it says in the title, i'm low on cash this month, and would greatly appreciate a pizza. i promise that'll come give back once i get back on my feet. 
[] anyone spare a pizza?. hi, i am not going to lie to try to get something i don't deserve, i am not dieing, begging for food, etc. but rather just wanting to know if i could get a pizza, if there is someone in need of one that has a bad situation (no food, can't feed kids, etc.) give it to them, i'd rather see true joy/happiness then just being full myself.  i can't do much in return other than draw a picture or say something or something a 15 year old can do, i can give you a free copy of portal 1 if you want.

thanks, and i hope this doesn't turn into a flame war or something.

[] had a rough time lately and could use a pick-me-up.. our family has been going through a rough time lately. we were involved in a car accident on thanksgiving, and the other driver (who was at fault) was uninsured. my husband was fairly significantly injured, and dealing with the hassles of medical bills, doctor and surgeon appointments, and suing for damages, on top of resuming school/teaching this week (i'm a graduate student) has left me emotionally, physically, and financially drained. 

we have three small kids, and i'm sure pizza would be a huge hit, as we haven't bought food from a restaurant in a long time. if anyone would be willing to save me from cooking tonight, i would be eternally grateful.

() pathetic couple in search of pizza to replace the holes in our hearts after losing our car to a pack of homeless people under a bridge. more in comments.. recently among our other financial woes we lost our car to a colony of homeless people under the i10 bridge in new orleans.  in addition to smashing almost all the glass and beating the sides with what we believe was a golf club, they also stole my so's suits which were in the backseat.  while we noticed several of these fine citizens sporting some ill fitting business attire, we chose not to approach.  we found the backseat around 50 yards away, but decided to leave that behind as well since a couple of very friendly men were in the process of making it their fuck pad.  everything that could physically be taken was, but they left us something in return!  they took a big poop in the trunk!  alas we miss the mitsubishi lancer, and the only thing that could possibly dissipate our grief is a delicious hot pizza.  
can provide pictures of car as well as pictures of our really cute dog.

thank you to fordgawn for the delicious bacon pizza!!!!

[]  georgia, usa - finally found a job after 7 months of unemployment, but don't get paid until next friday.  husband is craving pizza but we just can't afford it :(  can provide proof w/ account balances.. there is a papa johns right near us and i have a 50% off code if you'd like to use it. i looked and the total for the pizza we would like would end up being $11.66 with the coupon.

more info:  i started a new job on friday and we get paid every other week, starting next week (so i'll only get paid for one day on my first paycheck on 9/7).  we have about $1080 in our checking account and rent ($1050) comes out within the next couple of days.  husband won't get paid again until 9/14.  

as for proof, i can take a screenshot of our bank account balance and a couple of past rent deductions from the account so you can see the amount and them coming out the first of the month.  i can also show where he got paid on friday.

[] oklahoma usa - having a bad month, could use a pick-me-up. i've been having one heck of a time this month. first i came down with a really bad bug and missed work (full-time student so i only work a couple nights a week) then my water pump started leaking on my car. i spent every penny to my name on a replacement and managed to put the car back together without any left over bolts. then last monday the car decided that i did not need a transmission that works. so i'm stranded on foot waiting for income taxes to come in so i can fix/replace the car. 

i'm buried in homework at the moment and sitting here trying to finish a project thats worth half of my grade. a hot pizza would make the night much more enjoyable. 

thanks in advance

[] not in desperate need, but it'd be nice.. i know i am in no way original or the most deserving of a pizza, but basically, here's my story:
i met a girl awhile ago. we'll refer to her as an 80's metal musician. let's say, dave mustaine. dave and i started talking over a social media site, but for vagueness, we'll say headnovel. we met in real life shortly after, and became the best of friends very fast. about 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and i got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. to rectify this, dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. things went from best friends to relationship pretty fast. but dave had a boyfriend she never saw. literally, never. he asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. eventually, i told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. so i cut it off. fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. i wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. she frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. this time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. i didn't regret it at first. i do now. dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. but for some dumb reason, i still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. i wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that i thought was the girl of my dreams. i still want to fix it. but she just hurts me. all day, i've tried to act normal, like hang out with friends and such, and i just feel removed from it. i just want some comfort food and to listen to punk music and be the stereotypical heartbroken teenage boy.
tl;dr girl of my dreams breaks my heart and virginity and i would like some comfort food right now.

i'll pay it forward however you ask, if i can.

[] orlando, fl: couple in need of cheering up when down on luck.. so i live with my bf we are both unemployed currently. he has been searching for a job for the past 3 months after being laid off with no such luck, which is really beginning to take a toll on him. i have recently lost my job last week as well. bills/rent are coming up in the next week and we are still scrounging/selling whatever we possibly can. we have began running low on food within the past week (instant rice, cereal, and ramen). were afraid that if we go to buy groceries before bills/rent are paid off, we will not have enough to pay them. a pizza would be a nice change for dinner and quite possibly even help my bf to keep his head up and not get discouraged his job hunting.

i've completely run out of money and am basically stuck in my house, saving what little gas i have left for pursuing job prospects.  i've been eating through the last of my ramen during this past week or so and slowly depleting my reserve of oatmeal.

if anyone could send a pepperoni pizza, i'll be sure to keep the pizza-karma flowing once i land on my feet.

i'm also completely open to repaying the pizza favor with some non-money related favor, just let me know what you need.

[] hungry freshmen graphic designer getting through art school (mica) and spending the remainder of the night editing video.. i've been filming my first short film/documentary all week and i finally just hit editing stage. i got so wrapped up in filming that now i have to edit 60+ minutes of footage in around 10. i'm dedicated into making this as good as possible. 

oh and the short documentary is about people's reaction to the word dick and their views on masculinity. if you guys are interested in seeing the finished product i will definitely post it up. 
[] i'm employed. i have money. but it's been a really crappy week, and a raop would make me smile. (austin tx). wednesday: moved out of my house, marriage in shambles.

friday: in the er with kidney stones. intense amounts of pain.

saturday: missed my sister-in-law's wedding due to both previous events.

monday: reamed by my boss for shabby work, given this week to work on it.

today: oh crap it's wednesday already. a long evening of work awaits.

if anyone wants to order me an [austin's pizza](http://www.austinspizza.com/menu.php) (the redditor, of course) then it would add a little bright spot to my week. my friend, who's offering his couch rent-free, would appreciate the free grub as well. 

pm me if you're willing, no hard feelings if you're not.
[]setting my pride aside, my small family is 
hungry for the weekend.. edit! thanks to jetboyterp! he provided us with some nice grub for the night. it amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever i am able. i'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!

hello fellow redditors. i'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than i should, and i'll try to keep it short and simple. but let me mention, i am not one to ask for assistance. but there comes times when we must swallow our pride.

i have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. i'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. the last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. we are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. we've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.

i've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. this last week i've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.

also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. my cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. my family is hungry, but just for the day.

so here is my request, which i will counter with an offer. in exchange for a pizza, i will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. this is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of raop. i can provide any and all proof and verification needed. and whatever happens, i'd still like to thank raop for all their awesomeness.

note: come monday, i can get my paycheck advanced to me. yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from moday on. i've got a second job that i start tuesday at. it's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing i can do. thanks again reddit. :)

edit: i'm so sorry, i completely forgot to put my location, and i kept saying it in my head. :p anyways, i'm in south florida, right by ft. lauderdale.


[] arkansas - poor lonely college kid with almost no money. would really like a pizza tonight.. i don't know what else to say. iv been cooking for myself for awhile now (crappy soup, sometimes hamburger helper, and lots of rice) and would really like something that tastes good. i can provide proof of..me i guess or whatever. thanks for considering.

[] - battling bipolar disorder (ohio usa). i've had a difficult time dealing with this disease and being that i have no health insurance, it has left me pretty broke. i'm living off of ramen noodles at this point and would really like to change it up a bit. maybe the change will help my mental state a bit?

[] unemployment payment got delayed. waiting until wednesday for payments. raop would really keep me going. . recently, i had to file an extension for my u.i. but my payments ended up getting delayed from it and was force to overdraft a cheque to pay for rent. thankfully, i'm getting the payments by next week and some incoming gigs(barbacking) by wednesday. until then, i only have a few dollars and a supply of ramen. if anyone is willing to make my day by sending me pizza. i would be more then grateful for the random act of kindness.  i have a raop verification code if needed.

[] another sob story, but at least it's interesting (atlanta). new to reddit, guys on 4chan sent me this way so hopefully i strike a cord with someone. to sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since april of this year.

 i used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. i liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because i couldn't get to work (i couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). seems unlikely right? well this is sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. they don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. so as you can tell nothings beneath them. if you have any questions about sprint i'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.

i've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. i cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, i even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. you know, the usual stuff. i also tried the unusual, for a week i was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. then the company went under lol. just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. oh and crab shells or some crap like that, i dunno, i didn't keep the bottle they gave me.

my family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. ironically i hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. i'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. after all, i've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures i can do it again. of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. fair weather family is like that, thank goodness i'm the youngest. i take solace in that i'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?

since i got fired i don't get unemployment, and i'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs i qualify for either. work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now i'm without wheels. i tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when i got their, 3 hours early x.x tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then i found out god gives you hardships to make you stronger. sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up i find myself getting stronger and stronger. you can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that i'm built like a brick house.

so that's some of it, if i got into all of it we'd be here all day. i just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. tomorrow and thursday i'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since april i'll get offered a job. if nothing else wish me luck on that. also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse i've been afflicted with i'm selling it on the cheap =)
[] broke studying college student.. hey i would so grateful for a pizza right now. i am out of food at the moment, not even ramen left, and my pay check isn't coming till wednesday due to labor day weekend. i have some tests i am studying for right now, i am in rochester ny. 
[] beautiful day in rockville, md. so i'm enjoying the last days of unemployment (starting next wednesday woo!) by setting a blanket outside with a pillow and a power strip long enough for me to take my laptop outside and a book (the forever war). i'm not in particular need, but it's a gorgeous day, and i'm feeling like being a slug and it's my birthday tomorrow (me and my twin sister). never done this before, not quite sure of the process. again, not necessary at all and completely random! 

i love what you guys do here and will contribute once everything starts up. that being said, as far as random acts of cookies goes, someone motivate me to try out that recipe for key lime meltaways please! also, let me know if there's any verification needed for anything. or if there's any special procedure i should follow. if i do this, i want to do it right!
[] two final exams and a final paper tomorrow, going to be a long night (aurora, il). i'm going to be up pretty late tonight, and some pizza would be wonderful in helping me get through the night. any help is appreciated, thank you.
[] just an average kid... i think?. well, i don't have a life threatening disease, i'm not poor, i'm not anti-social and have friends... i mean, there's nothing that makes me stand out to want a pizza more than others. i just want pizza because it's fucking delicious. 

i go to school at ohio university and i just want pizza. any acts of pizzaness will be returned to another redditor.
() my waters been cutoff, i literally have nothing i can cook without it. stockbridge, ga. i've had a lot happen in the last year but i'm always trying to be positive and keep my head from sinking. i rode my water bill too long this time around. now just a few days before i could pay them it's been shut off, and they've made it clear they won't cut it back on without payment first. i live mostly off instant noodles and macaroni, now i can't even boil water for a cup of tea. right now my sink is loaded with dirty dishes that'll probably be ruined by the time i can run the dishwasher. i don't get anymore cash until this weekend, so the water isn't coming back anytime soon. i'm not working at the moment and i don't have wheels anymore either. my bank account is literally drawn down to the 70 cent mark, even if i had transport i couldn't buy anything substantial. 

when i asked a neighbor i get along with just to let me fill up a milk jug he told me no instantly. he acted like i was asking him at gun point. so he can borrow my edger, but me asking for a gallon of water is the line, apparently. i don't know what i'm going to do when i inevitably need to flush the toilet. i got a lot of time to come up with creative solutions but food isn't something i can come up with a fix for. i was going to live off spaghetti and macaroni until payday but now i'm stuck with no water to boil them in. i ate an uncooked ramen brick for a meal earlier, if i don't get some real food i think i'll go nuts. i can provide proof if someone needs it, i'll scan the note the left for me or whatever you guys wants. i'm being real here, i'm in a bad way and the end isn't in sight quite yet. can anyone help me?
[] my roommate and i have a physics test and a differential equations test tomorrow. will you make our last meal be pizza?. we have evil evil tests tomorrow and we will not sleeping much tonight as a result. pizza would be an amazing thing to have during this struggle. reasonable eccentric requests in return will be considered.
[] just moved into a new place, out of trees; with no money or food (except peanut butter and some stale sunflower seeds) until friday.. i think i could make a pizza last until friday, if anyone would like to help out a random college student i would really, really appreciate it.
[]burlington,ma- parents anniversary tonight, would love to treat my brothers to pizza!. my dad and stepmom are having their 5 year anniversary tonight! they're heading into boston and i would love pizza for the rest of the family (tim, kraig, carl, randy and kev + me) but i am all out of money until thursday! will pay it forward!
[] my computer isn't good enough to play minecraft and now i'm depressed. . i just bought 4 gbs of new ram to make it run better, but it's still unplayable. i was looking forward to playing multiplayer with my brother. needless to say, i'm pretty disappointed. i'm in utah county.
extremely hungry []. [request]go to college at san francisco state, live in sf,
haven't eaten an actual meal in a few days, besides a few slices of bread. please give me something to eat i get paid on the 15th :(
[] extremely embarrassed...and starting to feel a bit hopeless.... this is obviously a throwaway. i've attempted to make a request before, but no one fulfilled it. i decided it would be wise to disclose a bit more about my situation, but i'm super embarrassed, hence the throwaway. if anyone offers, i'd be more than happy to message you via my regular reddit account. i've given and received before. 

things are looking pretty bleak for us, food-wise (thankfully, we're okay in other areas of our lives). it is literally just food. i'm embarrassed to say this, but we're at a point where we had to apply for food stamps. (i don't think there is anything wrong with food stamps or people who need them, i just never thought we'd be in this dire state of need.) i got all my verification turned in, but it is taking them so long to process it. i am hoping we get it before thanksgiving, since their office will be closed from thursday-monday. i don't know what i'll do if they fail to complete processing my application before their thanksgiving break. from the way things are going, it seems unlikely.

if anyone could send me a gift card for a pizza, i'd be so grateful. i'd pay it forward in anyway i can. 

we couldn't pay our internet/phone bill. thankfully, free wi-fi is only a short walk away. if you respond to this, please understand that i probably won't be able to respond to you until tomorrow morning. 
[] just moved to ak and now we are broke and have no food.. my fiance and i just moved to ak to spend time with his grandfather who is doing poorly and return to where he grew up. in doing so we have a grand total of 1.55 cents in change and would love to have something substantial to eat other then the few packs of ramen we have to live off of for a month which is worse then the food rationing we have to do with the pets the poor things. we would love a pizza miracle in our home! next month when we have money we will pay it forward to another desperate soul &lt;3

[] 2 starving mexicans just craving some papa johns.. my buddy and i just went on a mission across chicago to supposedly pick up my paycheck. turns out they didn't have it, and now we just spent our last dollar on two slurpees from 7-11. 


would love a pizza right now, and papa johns would seem like the best fit, seeing as how it's right down the street from where i'm by, but would take any of the big 3. appreciate it. 


will pay it forward once my paycheck actually comes through.
[] today is the opportune time to help my mother realize the kindness of reddit!. after having just finished paying two months rent, and my sister's infant getting sick, our family is in a seriously tight bind, cash wise, for the next two weeks. we've had troubles before though and made it through, this just makes it the perfect time to ask for your help in solving the real problem...

after almost a year of trying to convince her otherwise, my mother believes that reddit is at it's core, a place where people go to lie about how wonderful their life is or post pictures of their animals. (basically anything told to her about reddit from watching the news) she doesn't realize that reddit can be a great source of kindness that can touch even the average user if you seek it from subs such as [/r/depression](/r/depression) , [/r/progresspics](/r/progresspics) and of course [/r/random_acts_of_pizza](/r/random_acts_of_pizza).

with our recent cash problems, it would go a very long way in making her realize how important reddit has been to me, along with hopefully making her realize the true nature of the people on this site, if she were to receive a pizza from a generous stranger during a difficult time.

thank you in advance! this site and this subreddit are wonderful!

[] phoenix, arizona. middle school theatre students staying late (till nearly 8pm) to rehearse for their production of willie wonka jr. we all would greatly appreciate anything! help put a cheesy smile on their face?. all this week, these students are working hard on getting this musical perfect, and they don't have anything for dinner. anyone willing to give them some pizzas for monday-wednesday? the students would greatly appreciate it! pm for any questions. we can perform a song or two if someone wants? :)
[] (norfolk, va) newlyweds in search of sustenance!. my husband and i recently got married and moved into a new place, spent money on rent, furniture, groceries. i just recently found a job but i don't start until next weekend. my husband is in the military but don't let that fool you, they give us just enough to pay our bills and we've been eating rice for days. i would appreciate any redditor willing to help us out so we can enjoy our saturday night together once he comes home from work. i will definitely pay it forward as soon as i start work next weekend!

[] in the process of moving... could really use some pizza. [medicine hat, ab, canada]. i'm tired, sweaty and hungry and i don't want to turn on the oven in this heat.

i could draw you a picture or something but i can't promise you that it would be any good. or i could send you a picture of me, super happy and eating pizza.
[] denver, co hitting some hard times, anything would help!. my gf and i have hit some hard times with her losing her job and then unemployment as well for being physically unable to perform her job due to various hand injuries as a server in a restuarant. she is currently petitioning to have unemployment reinstated due to medical reasons for being unable to perform her job, but until then things are really tight and anything would help us out right now. 

i've been both a giver and receiver in raop before and would certainly return the favor again when i am able to reciprocate. it took everything we have to pay rent today and some food would go a long ways towards making our next couple of days go by much better with some food.



thanks :)

edit: raop, not roap :)
[] moved to a new city, broke until next friday when i get my first paycheck. no food besides pb&amp;j. could really use some help.. finally got a job but the way the first pay works i am without for another week. if someone could help me out that would be amazing.

[] help me do something nice for my family holly, mi usa. so here's the lowdown, i'm a 23 m fresh out of the army. april 17th 2013 and we are living with my wife's parents until we can get on our feet. i have been expecting my last paycheck for a while now but it seems long to come.
both of her parents are in their 70's and living on retirement checks so i feel really bad about being here. but we have no where else to go. i will have money soon but not in time for it to help. (pulling my tsp, retirement) and what not.
i have 1 boy 2 yrs and a pregnant wife and 2 older people, one on oxygen. i would love to be able to do something nice as a treat for them but i have no money.
anything would be amazing, i'm not saying we need it but i would rather not eat bean soup again and give us something nice to talk over.
you can call me and we can talk a bit, if you are willing to help, or even if not just message me.
thank you in advance anyone willing to help.
[] pizza for my fiancee. okay so to keep things short, my fiancee has been having a really rough week and i'd like to surprise her with some pizza. the only problem is due to some recent financial obligations and trouble, i am low on funds and unable to buy it for her. so if anyone has any good coupons or deals, or would be willing to gift her some pizza i'd be really gratefully and will definitely gift it forward as soon as i can. she has papa johns and dominos nearby, and we are located in lynchburg, virginia.

thanks!!
[][usa]could use something nice to eat.. planning a cross-country move in a week (davison, michigan to maine), but currently broke and living on ramen and occasionally my roommates' leftovers. i would seriously appreciate a break from that, even a small one. there's a pizza hut and a hungry howie's (michigan chain) near me that both do online ordering, and they're about the same price but only pizza hut does gift cards, so i'm not quite sure how to go about it. i've only gotta feed myself, so i don't necessarily need much. i can try to pay you back, if you don't mind it possibly taking a while- i'm moving to look for a job. 

p.s. if either of my roommates see this: hey guys look, there's a subreddit for this!
[] in centralia il. hi i a m new to this site hope that i do this right.  im wishing for a pizza today for my family.  we have not have anything as i am awaiting approval for snap and currently no food pantrys today.  hope someone out there would grant our wish. we have a dominos.. pizza hut in our town.  thankyou so much and godbless
[] northern nj - your pizza donation will feed two of us for 2 days.. my wife and i are filing for bankruptcy very soon.  in the meantime, we are very close to running out of food, and we are out of money until i get paid next friday.  we're not pigs - we can easily make a pizza last for two dinners between the two of us.  it would get us that much closer to my next paycheck without starving.

we would really, really appreciate a pizza from some kind redditor right about now.  i can provide verification if needed.

thanks for reading!

location: northern nj
[] working second, left my lunch and wallet at home and got the cravings. will pay forward tomorrow!. the dominos doesn't deliver here but pizza hut does! i'll also throw in some reddit gold since i can pay for that with google checkout!

any kind hearted souls out there mind hooking me up?
[] uk | just came home from abroad to find my debit card is blocked and can't get bank to fix until monday :(. not the end of the world if nobody offers but would be a really nice change to a shitty few days! would love a medium from dominos or maybe just a couple of their sides to be cheaper

on monday i'll pass on the favour (not because i'm a nice person or believe in karma, i'd just feel like a bit of a dick otherwise..)

thanks in advance if anyone is kinda enough x

edit: should maybe point out, was hoping for this sometime this afternoon or evening, no rush on it
[] it's lunch time. can someone help me with a pizza please? park city, ut. i'm not new to reddit. i often look through posts on this subreddit wondering if it's okay to post from my main account or not. i decided against it and i hope that doesn't scare anyone away. the kids and i had pb&amp;j (peanut butter and jelly for the uninitiated) for breakfast and we are now debating our options. we are not without food, but would just like something different. a pizza would definitely help us forget about our breakfast. pb&amp;j is great, but eating it day after day gets old. i hope someone will please consider us. any pizza place would work, the little ones and i can share a pizza. thank you. 
() lost my job last week, behind on my payments and credit score is dying on me. lighten up my life?. pls. got verification code. will dance and tape it for gift cards. delivery is fine too. got dominos nearby, thats pretty much it. its too early right now, but later today id love the pizza. pls.

[] will you be my angel tonight? [seattle]. dear /r/random_acts_of_pizza

i come before you now as a humble man. i would like to think i am an honest man so i shall tell you an honest tale. 

my name is dave and i currently am working at a homeless shelter for homeless youth in seattle called roots. i love working at roots, i can sleep easily in the mornings (since i work throughout the nights) knowing that i am helping keeping 30 homeless youth off the streets and away from snowzilla's wrath as he stomps through seattle. 

snowzilla has ruined things here in seattle. because of the nature of the place i work at, someone must be on staff every night, and i have to work throughout the weekend and since the buses are closed? i must walk 5 miles in ice and snow to get to work. 

sadly though, i don't get paid very much. [(bank statement)](http://imgur.com/dveeh) but that is the way of the world working for a homeless shelter. i haven't eaten in the last day and a half because of there being nothing in my kitchen [my fridge](http://imgur.com/05ffr) and stores being closed.

so i am asking you all, if you are willing, would be able to show a snowed-in man with no money some kindness? even under these difficult times, and even if whether or not my ask for some kindness has no results, know that i have fun even when times are grim [i did it all for you, reddit!](http://imgur.com/bhnxu)

i hope you can all find it in your hearts to give some kindness my way. i hope you all have a safe time as snowzilla causes havoc in everyone's regions and i live you with one last picture.

[] my dog has been having cluster seizures. i'm exhausted and need some cheesy encouragement.. i barely slept last night so this won't be very eloquent. yesterday evening my little dog had a seizure. she's had them before (very rare, vet said not to worry bc of infrequency) so we let her ride it out and she seemed to be feeling better. then at 5am this morning she had another seizure, then another at 8am. i brought her to the vets where she got diagnosed with epilepsy and given some medicine. when we got home she had a 4th seizure and i had to bring her back for iv medication and medical monitoring. i'm a grad student (ergo broke) and am out $450 in vet bills just today and worried sick about my pup. 

please help me out. there is a papa john's nearby and also a locally owned small pizza place that does online orders. i can provide proof of my story and i'm sure my pup would love a little pizza crust when we get to bring her home. 
[] a broken car that needed towing took the last of our dough, a pizza pick me up would be greatly appreciated. my girlfriends car broke down on the side of the road last night, and she spent the last of our money getting it towed 60 miles back home (bellingham, wa.). this expense means she will now be unable to pay utilities or the car payment this month. the only reason she was down there was because we were not getting along, which was mostly my fault. i have no money but would like to give her a pick me up. some za would probably do the trick. any help would be appreciated.
[] would love a celebration pizza (in virginia). my husband and i are buying our first new car today.  we are not in dire straights by any means, but buying a new car is definitely putting a huge dent in our wallets.  i would like to surprise my husband tonight with a celebratory pizza that didn't put any extra strain on our bank account.  the car payments over the next 5 years will being doing enough of that.  thank you!
[] hungry in vancouver, bc, canada. my wife and i aren't paid until the weekend and money's pretty tight at the moment.   any help would be greatly appreciated.
[] pizza for a down and out college student. here is the story! 

so, i'm a broke, recently unemployed college student dealing with some stress. 

i did something i've never done before, and asked for a pizza. 

and then i had second thoughts, because i felt really horrible asking for a pizza when there are people out there with real problems. so i deleted my post. 

then, an amazing redditor pizza'd me anyways, so i am redoing this post so that the proper flair can be assigned. 

thank you, lordelf, i will repay your kindness as soon as i am able to.

[] melbourne australia. was ripped off by my employer, and anything other than rice would be greatly appreciated!  :). i've been working door to door installing those tv energy saver things, and we get paid per unit as a sub contractor. my boss just decided that he isn't going to pay me. i'm owed about $1500, and there are 2 others in the same boat.

the last of my money i spent on rice and potatoes. it's hard to believe, but i have literally not spent any money in 3 weeks! i'm waiting on my tax return, and that day can't come soon enough. if you have any questions, i have some pretty hilarious stories about going door to door in rural victoria, the job itself was pretty awesome. 

oh, and cheers to vodafone who gave me free phone credit so i could get my tax submitted. very cool of them. if you're kind enough to donate a pizza, i'd be very grateful and would obviously pay it forward. :)
[] san francisco ca, stuck at work on 12hr shift. brokish, lonely and hungry. ~~so here is the deal, im stuck at work on a 12hr shift over night in a completely empty 12 story high rise. i dont have enough cash to order pizza ($6) and nothing close enough that i can afford(even if i did sneak away i.e. mcd/jacnk in the box/taco bell). can pay it forward in the future~~

() denver, co - unemployed, struggling guy trying to get a warm meal. so i've fallen on some really hard times, and i've never done something like this, but after reading through some of the posts on here, i was taken aback at the kindness of the community, so i figured i'd give it a whirl.

i'm a 24 year old guy, living with two roommates that i absolutely loathe, unemployed for the past 5 months, busting my back looking for a job, and reaching the end of both my money and sanity.

i've been "borrowing" food from my roommates for a couple weeks now, but i hate having to go to them for anything, so i've been relegated to ramen and pickles.  if you've never tried them together, do yourself a favor and don't.

so, if someone had the urge and would be willing to help me out, if even for a day, i would be incredibly grateful and appreciative.

thanks everyone
[] atlanta, ga usa- dad just lost his job and got no severance pay, thought a pizza would make him feel better. -a weird power struggle at my fathers work ousted him of his position and severance pay.

-we both spent most of our remaining funds on a car we can share because he will no longer have a company car to drive.

-pizza sounds great right now but we're both too broke for one. 

-any words/thoughts/pizzas greatly appreciated

**** starving college students trying to graduate. my roommate and i are hopefully graduating next week on my birthday, currently doing an all-nighter but our grumbling tummys are interfering with our studying. rent is due tomorrow so that means no funds :( however a pizza with pineapple tomato and canadian bacon from wise guys would most likely help us focus, and thus graduate. making our last four years worthwhile. 
[] texas, broke and stressed. please don't judge that my account is new, i know it is frowned upon. but i was referred to here by an old friend who had received help here before. 

me and the room mate have been struggling on cut hours to make ends meet, but this week has been hell. my kitchen has become full of gnats, and despite all my cleaning and scrubbing of every corner they refuse to leave. now, i know it can take a while for them to go away, but what's frustrating about it is that i put my last bit of spending money into trying to get rid of these things. my girlfriend won't let me cook for her in fear of these things getting in the food.

now, we get paid again in just a couple of days. and a pizza is all we need to get us there. i hate begging, i do. but once we get paid and i am able to spend again i promise to either pay back the person that helped me, or pay it forward. anyone please?

[ing] worried mother..... my son has recieved his meal, thanks veritas27!

my son is in dire need, i'm from central california, a mother of 5, and cash is really tight here at home. my oldest child joined the army in december of 09, he had just turned 19 then, however during his training at ft. benning he substained a back injury and was medically released from the service in aug. 2010. it happen 2 weeks before his graduation he was on his last phase, i had bought my non refundable airline tickets a few days before that had happened. he came home and literally had to be on his back for 6 months, we didnt have the money nor insurance for him to get proper treatment, nor was there any offered to him by the army, he toughed it out but he fell into deep depression.. by feb. this year, he started training himself in shape, and began looking for any work, unfortunately nothing came up, that only lead to him feeling more depressed, having to see his dad work long hours at a very labor job to support all of us, he couldnt bare it and decided to take a chance in another state, hes in portland, or. right now, with his cousin, still trying to establish himself there, he's been there for about a month struggling, he just got a mailing address and now he can get an oregon id, right now he just haves his military id, he doesnt except any cash from me, cause he says he rather it go to the babies (his little sisters 5 and 6) i worry about him eating constintly, instead i dried some cheap beef to jerky, and boxed some ramens to him. my son is struggling to get something started, i pray that something good will happen for him, and i think that something like this, would lift his spirits, that someone was thinking of him..

[] willis tx, pizza. here's the story i have a sick three year old and was up all night. i am tired, my house is a disaster, and i feel lazy. we live on a limited income so can't afford to spend extra on pizza especially with school starting next week and trying to get kids ready with supplies, clothes, fees, and all the crap. i would love a pizza. if anyone has it in their heart to help me out we have papa johns, dominos, pizza hut, and little ceasers opened yesterday.

[] working woman with an asshole roommate could use a pizza.. not sure if this is the purpose of this reddit. please excuse the new account, i saw this on the news, what an amazing idea!

i am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. the problem is that this girl is so lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and i'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. i have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. to top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother refuses to answer my phone calls or emails. so here i am reddit, living with a girl who labels her food in the fridge so i don't touch it, and for the sake of keeping the peace...i am down to begging for a pizza x(.  i would prefer giftcards, because i would rather give out my email address than my physical address, but i will understand those who dont want to in case they believe i am a scammer.

[] withing the past 2 weeks, 2 of my friends have become jobless and homeless, so i'm letting them crash with me until they get back on their feet. nothing left in the cupboards now but canned soup, pizza would be fantastic. . my life has gotten pretty crazy over the past 2 weeks. two of my good friends are sleeping in my living room (one just got divorced and moved back here from another state, he does some under the table work but is running low on cash. the other has just had some bad luck in life and has had a few offers that look promising, so i'm letting him stay until one goes through.) my boyfriend just started working again after being out of work for a few months, but he doesn't get paid until tomorrow. rent was due this week and all that's left in my cupboard is cheap canned soup. pizza would really help the morale around here, and i'll pay it forward at the end if the month (i've got 2 weeks of over time coming up.)
[] arizona usa broke, and it ain't no joke...... i just moved got a place with my friend! excited but at the same time it doesn't leave much in the bank if you know what i mean. its been the first of the month and we have budgeted well and used our resources sparingly. it is now almost near the end of our journey and we find our selves on the couch wondering how many cup of noodles have we eaten? frankly, i can stick it out and so can my friend.... but it would be awesome to eat something that's not soup! :) me and my friend would appreciate anything

[] louisiana student. i aced my income tax test today!. hey raop, long time lurker, first time poster here. my bank account has $2.78 in it, and my car is on e. meaning that i can't drive home this weekend to celebrate the super bowl with my family, and i'll be eating canned soup again tonight. i already had that for lunch and i would really love a pizza. my loans come in next monday (they would have come in sooner but the fin aid office screwed something up). i'll gladly return the favor if you help me out tonight! also, i just aced my income tax test that's i've been studying for all week, and last week i made a 98 on my managerial accounting test! :)
[] we just ate the last bag of lipton noodles and split a can of vienna sausages.... it's been a rough summer here. it may be cold in the d but it's pretty cold in flint town too. my roommate totaled his car, we were living five deep in here paying 100/person in rent and 3/5 roommates moved out this week.  we are both unemployed at the moment, i just got hired in somewhere but i won't get paid  for another two weeks.  we are kind of shitting bricks about what we are going to eat.  all of our money is going to utilities, and to pay rent.  if there is a kind redditor out there who could extend some sort of relief my roommate and i would be so incredibly grateful.  we just need a little bit of relief until we can get some food assistance.
[] pizza to lift spirits. i'm intimidated to ask for food like this, but my husband works five days a week to support the two of us and our puppy. he always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. we try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.

this week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for thursday (he gives plasma thurs/sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

on his way home from the biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the biolife card to get gas. the pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, i believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. my husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. when he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. my husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back monday.

it would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome thursday night we had planned. the favor *will* be returned by saturday when he gives plasma again! we've never done this so if you're willing to walk us through how to go about receiving and then giving back when able it would be greatly appreciated!

[] hungry and craving pizza in ny. let me start off by saying that i've read some of the posts here a few times and have always wanted to give someone a pizza. 

i lost my job over 4 months ago, right before my wedding. we had an idea that it was going to happen so we saved up some money. our savings and my wife's job have been enough to pay the bills for the last 4 months. but that money has run out. 

last week i was lucky enough to find a part time job but i haven't started it yet. my wife and i have no money right now and have been eating hot dogs and ramen for the last week (seriously, 7 days). we could both really go for not-a-hot-dog for dinner.

thanks for everything raop!

**edit** i should say that i'm in upstate ny.

[] no money until payday, accounts in the negative and i have run out of food :(. hi everyone,

i have heard of this place and been here before, this is the first time i am posting. as of yesterday i am officially out of food and money. i've been living on nutri-grain bars for the past month that i had managed to purchase from the store i work at (if they're expired, an employee can purchase them for 75% discount + the normal 10% employee discount, so i jumped on em) however now i am completely out. 

i will get paid this friday, but that paycheck will almost entirely go to bills minus the amount of money i need to feed myself. i'm not going to exaggerated and claim that my situation is dire (it is thursday and i only have to hold out until tomorrow) because there probably is someone out there who needs it more than i do. however, if there is a kind stranger out there who has the means and decides to reward me, i would be so much in their debt.

happy valentines day reddit, and thank you.

[] broke college student suffering through the hottest day of the year. i am a  broke student at the university of oregon sitting in my inferno of a house. it's 91 degrees today, which might not seem drastic to many, but it's the hottest day since i have been at school and there is no way we have air conditioning, let alone more than one small fan. pizza would be greatly appreciated, prevent myself from venturing into the humid warzone that is the outdoors.

[] joining the u.s. marines and having difficulty making ends meet till i go to basic.. so here is my story. i am 21 years of age and have studied music at the university of arkansas for 2 and a half years. last sememster i decided to change majors and it cost me so much in scholarships that i cannot afford school anylonger. i figured i would work for a semester, maybe a year, then go back to school and keep moving forward. well i work at a video game store and i love it. the one problem is that i am having to payfor things that i usually didn't have to before. so while struggling i decided to consider the military. i did a lot of research and am now deciding between the marines and the army. i want to join the marines but i am keeping my options open until i get as much info as i can. i am going to be moving back in with my parents next month in order to try to save some money but until then i have been living off of granola bars and the occasional ramen. i've had to sell my video games and musical instruments to pay rent and such and have to pay for gas in change most if the time. anyways thank you for your time. 

tl;dr: struggling hungry dude moving in with parents in order to survive till joining the military.

p.s. this whole thing was typed on an iphone so sorry for any errors.
[] wa been a hard two months for me and my grandpa. could really use a pizza. this last couple months have been hard for me and my grandpa, early in june my grandma passed away and although we've been managing to get by but it hasn't been easy. other than when the occasional family member brings over some food we've mostly been living off ramen and sandwich meats until one of us can find a job. (previously we stayed home because of my grandma and our funds came through her from the state)

could really just use a pizza to boost morale for me and my grandpa.

[] college student struggling to get by please help.. i am a new college student and have been having a real hard time these first few weeks with financial aid and as a result i am not on a meal plan this year.  because of this i have to buy all of my own food which is a problem because i have very little money to begin with.  ive been having 1 ramen cup a day and thats all i have eaten in 4-5 days.  im really hungry and a friend recommended this subreddit.  please help.
[]wife and daughter are hungry, shipping an item for ebay broke the bank.. we both work but it's still paycheck to paycheck. i sold an item on ebay to get some extra cash but since it was an awkward item to ship(giant plush lady and the tramp dog), it jacked the shipping from $30 to $58, i had to pay the $28 out of pocket since i told the buyer it would be only $30. so that sapped our funds until we get paid tomorrow. until then, we starve as we have nothing at the house to eat. not trying to give a sob story, just being honest.

but hey if we got a pizza, maybe the wife would stop bragging about pinterest :-)
() new here, giving it a try. hello everyone. i just heard about this site through one of my friends. i have been struggling with my finances as i am a newly single mom, i have a 10 month old daughter. my friend told me about this site, and said that she had received a pizza when she was in need, and that it really helped her. i figured i would give it a try. i know i just registered on reddit, and that many people will see that as a bad thing, but i'll do anything to prove that i'm real.

my husband and i just got a divorce. my daughter and i moved into our own apartment, and i am trying to get back on my feet. i am in the midst of getting things in order with job and family services, but until then i'm broke.

so, if anyone can help, that would be great! when i get back on my feet, i will surely pay it forward.

[] looking to suprize my family back home and i need advice (ne arkansas). i am a deployed soldier in afghanistan and i am wanting to suprize my wife with a pizza or something cool. i only have a few problems:

* wife is visiting kinfolk in harrisburg, ar which is a town of maybe 2000 with 1-2 mom and pop pizza places that may or may not be open today or tomorrow. one of these is [checkers pizza](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;startindex=&amp;startpage=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;q=pizza+in+harrisburg,+arkansas&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=pizza&amp;hnear=0x87d437d6283197f9:0xa55b439652fb393a,harrisburg,+ar&amp;cid=17044012131257561687)

* the only place with chain restaurants is 11-15 miles away in jonesboro, ar and i am pretty sure they do not deliver.

[] just hit the point of desperate. before i tell my story this is a throw away account, i don't want my friends to find out just how bad my family has it right now..

with that out of the way, i just want the chance for my family to eat something decent for a change.  right now our house is going up for short sale, and we have to move out.  my parents couldn't afford the mortgage anymore, and bank of america was completely unwilling to work with us in some kind of payment plan; so we're forced to sell and move.  if that wasn't bad enough, i just graduated college and can't get a job (been trying for months, every day; hours on end). 

my step dad was in the hospital for a routine procedure and ended up contracting sepsis.  so every six hours he has to attach an iv with ampicillin (some of the strongest anti-biotics you can take) so he's unable to work.  while he was in the hospital for almost three weeks, i was taking care of my siblings, making them dinner (which consists of 4-5 chicken nuggets every day..).

this is becoming quite long and i don't want to write a novel, but i'm really truly desperate right now for something to eat (besides nuggets).  i appreciate your time, reddit.

question regarding s from uk. hello,

before i ask my question i want to make it clear i am in no way accusing anyone of anything and i am in no position to buy anyone pizza in fact i am probably more in need of a pizza haha...

anyway, i've noticed that most if not all requests from the uk seem to go unanswered, why is this? is it not possible to buy pizza for someone in the uk from america? or would people rather look after their own country men before others...

i'd really love to find a way to help my uk bros get some pizza. any suggestions? thank you.

edit: i would love to get involved with any ideas people have.

[]what has two thumbs and is starving? (florida). this guy!! i was gonna do a weird punchline involving some kind of cuddly animal, but then i realized most animals don't have thumbs...or do they...? anyways i'm going to be honest here, i really am hungry; totally famished, and i've been listening to my stomach growl since i've woken up. basically i'm waiting for school to start so i can receive my financial aid in order to purchase books and more importantly food. unfortunately that isn't for another 2 weeks....which has kind of left me in a desperate situation. hence the raop request. for those wary gifters out there i know...this is a new account and thus this request will probably be treated as a scam but i assure you that i am indeed a real live hungry college student. starving, some might say, stupid as well for hoping $150 could buy me a months worth of food, but alas, a man can dream. anyways, a pizza or a gift card would really go a long way; a gift card more so because i would stave off hunger as long as possible, but any food right now would be fantastic and i would really appreciate the help. well, thanks for reading.
[] would really like to eat something other than ramen for a change.. hey guys i've been without stable income for a couple months now and have eaten nothing but ramen for 2 weeks. any money i end up scraping together goes to my rent so i'm not couch surfing. i was just wondering if anyone would be able to help me out here. ramen is ok but it makes me want to hurl after a while. here is my bank account http://imgur.com/ww08gm5  i don't know if ill be able to provide anyone with any in the near future but if someone could help me out that would be great and if not that is fine to. thank you for your time.

my sister is a chicago teacher, and she says they'll begin picketing, tomorrow, so sending deliveries to schools in striking districts will likely reach appreciative mouths, as well.

[] ohio usa could really use a cure for my not wanting to eat.. i've been having a stressed out anxiety ridden week. i've had issues with my eating but not bad enough to be considered anorexic. so i've been eating sporadically. sleeping not so well either. 

i tend to use weed to help me actually want to eat. well it's not really been working. been smoking since yesterday and haven't gotten the desire to eat. 

that is until i started thinking about pizza. i think i was even just reading the word pizza. i instantly started fantasizing about pizza. then hit my brick wall when i remembered i have no money due to 4/20.

i know i need to eat, but i just can't see me putting in the effort to make something i'll actually eat.

[] pelzer,sc no ac and don't want to turn on the oven.. my boyfriend had to go to the er a few days ago and i got behind on laundry so i'm already going to have to turn on the dryer and heat the house up more. we have a portable ac in one room but it's working hard today and i'm still rather miserable. i also had my first encounter with morning sickness this morning and i hate touching/looking/smelling raw meat lately so a nice pizza that i dont have to turn the oven on for sounds so great right now. thanks for reading/considering!
[] just a humble /story, a million thanks just for reading.. hey raop. i've been pretty down lately, some dark thoughts been going through my head, i think a big part of that is my uncle (whom i live with) is suspected of having bladder cancer. i can't describe to you or put into context how unfortunate this is for our family, i mean cancer is usually horrible but on top of the hardship our family is facing this is absolutely devastating. my uncle, my mother, and me are supported by my grandmother. we all live in the same fairly small house, i'm the only one who has a (low wage retail) job and i'm working there and going to school so that soon i can get out of here alive, things are so stressful here. i usually wake up to people arguing and yelling at each other, my car needs a new transmission, i need tons of dental work, i really don't feel like going on a lot of the time but i stay positive and just try to reflect on the fact that i am working and making good grades.

so, i hope that didn't bore you, i didn't get too detailed. as for a pizza, if someone feels like getting me one that would be cool as i am broke until friday, and we don't have much food here, also we have roaches so a lot of the food is contaminated. ugh. a pepperoni + bell pepper pie from someone would really give me a little hope.

thanks for reading...

[] will paint my walls any one color you choose princeton ky. i've been wanting to choose a different color for my room. i don't think anything like this has been done here before (long term lurker) so hopefully i get some points for at least being original. yes this is a request and yes i will paint my walls any one color that my generous offer-er requests. i'm **not** starving, trying to feed 10 people, telling a made up sob story, or crying over having ugly walls. still with me? ok. lets have some fun with this!

i have linked some pictures below, so that you see what you have to work with. the walls are an off white/egg color (bleh). have you ever gone to someone's house and thought "wow, why did they pick this stupid color?" i am regretting my decision of selecting this color. just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. maybe i just have dirty fingers? :d

i hope i can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. i'm not a good designer by any means. i still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. no wonder i'm single. 

anyway, i want to thank you for reading my very long post. i hope you enjoy your saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. please pick a good color. any color other than white/egg shell. please and thank you :)

[potential ] pizza for an aussie . hey raop

this is a throwaway account but i'd be happy to pm you from my real account as verification. i've given before and never received.

first up i'd like to say that pizza is not necessary and we won't starve without it. not even a bit. we've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). so, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. 

i'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. my boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. so we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. rego is nearly $1000! add insurance, nrma membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! what. the. hell. (yes, i *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)

add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :p
we literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. this is an odd and disconcerting feeling. 

what would pizza mean to us? laughter and joy. the pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. a memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. a small easing of financial stress for the next few days. 

i might also pull the request later because like i said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. and anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :p

but thanks for reading anyway, raop!

also, please and thank you ;)

[] in kansas city mo, no money til friday and we just ate the last of our food.. my so is the only one working right since i'm still looking for work. he has spent all of the money on bills and the hell hole apartment and now we are both sitting around trying to figure out what to do for food. we have tried to find people on craigslist to buy our backwards compatible hacked ps3 but the only replies we got were from scams. in short, a pizza sounds so good right now and it sure can raise our hope and morale too. please reddit, a pizza pie for two hungry people?

[] just having a really bad week, would like some warm comfort food.. hello, i've just really had a bad week.  to sum things up, i found out my wife cheated on me 9 days ago.  i've since moved, but my fridge is empty and i'm basically broke due to the move until the 17th.  if you want more details please just look at my post history, but i'd rather keep all of that out of this thread.
 
 
 
i really just want some warm pizza to eat while i watch a few movies with my dogs.  i know i'm posting this on a throwaway account, but i wanted to explain the situation and can't use my main account to protect my self and my (cheating) wife.
 
 
thanks.

[] my boyfriend and i have $0 until tuesday :(. i don't like asking people for things, but we're going through a rough couple of months, since my boyfriend is a software contract worker and had to take some time off before starting work again (tomorrow actually is his first day back at microsoft! hooray!) but, that means we're completely out of money until i get paid on tuesday, and we would seriously love some pizza. 


i promise to pay it forward on tuesday and buy someone else in need a pizza. i feel horrible for asking, but we don't really have any other options. we live in the seattle area, if that helps. thank you so much in advance.

[] california, usa would like to bacon the norwhal for pizza at midnight.. (or sooner. lol) my husband and i (newly married gay couple may 10th, 2012. (facebook.com/strit9boy).

() been up all night crying, screaming, and now starving. jacksonville fl.. i'm not new to reddit and i'm not from jacksonville either. sorry but i'm requesting incognito because i don't want anyone i know to find out about what's happening right now. there's a really messed up situation and i haven't even told my dad about this yet, so i don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.

i got a surprise yesterday when a guy i've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. my girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! she was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. i've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, i was raised better than that, but i've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!

after a two hour conversation with this dude i find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. he's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! she goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. my girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!

i'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because i've been living with this tramp for over a year now, i got no place else to go right now. i need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. i'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when i get paid. but for today, i need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and i think he would appreciate it too.

sorry again for being a bit deceptive with my post. if i wasn't starving i wouldn't be spreading it around for that matter either. if anyone can help you have my gratitude. 

8:30 am. taking a trip out and about, will be back in a few hours to check the thread.

[] so i'm really really hungry.... so today i've had the worst day ever basically. this morning me and my girlfriend got into a huge fight, and she left me for who knows how long. not to mention i lost my job a week ago or so. i just ran out of trees (yes i am an ent) and the entire town is dry at the moment (i live in orlando). i'm also running really low on money, and don't have any income coming in any time soon, seeing as i just lost my job. on top of all of this, my two bestfriends have been total douchebags lately, and we were supposed to go get cici's pizza later today (it's only 5 bucks) but they both bailed on me. this has been the 5th time in the past few weeks that they've ditched me, for no reason at all. anyways, if any of you redditors would be kind enough to send a guy a pizza now, i would really appreciate it
[]in need in orlando, fl. no big sob story.  actually kept going back and forth to even post this.  long story short, broke till payday, need some lunch.  once i decided i will definitely pay it forward when i get paid, i figured what could it hurt.  also seems to be a really fun concept to be a part of.  

in closing, thanks.  as stated, i will be back at the end of the week to pay it forward to others.

[] looking for a pick me up. well to cut to the chase i am living with hcm (hypertrophic cardiomyapthy) and i have been having some trouble breathing lately.  being uninsured, i go to the urgent care center and the doc tells me that i suffered a mild heart attack sometime last week.  it hit me kind of rough because i haven't had an episode in years and i've been really healthy. all my family is 8+ hours away and to be honest it feels good to just tell someone in general.  

anything reassuring would really boost my spirits/confidence in the matter if only an 'it's going to be ok.'  thanks in advance and once my spirits pick up, i promise to pay it forward.
[] after two trips to convenient care for some health problems i have run out of money for food. happy to reciprocate on friday.. i am a 22 year old man with a job that doesn't pay extremely well and does not offer insurance.  a full hospital visit is not an option for me financially, so my only options are walk in clinics.  i recently started feeling some severe abdominal pain and ended up going to the clinic two times before it was determined i had a blockage.  i am happy to be feeling much better, but that broke me and i have officially run out of money for food.  i would appreciate a pizza today more than you know.  i would be happy to buy someone in need a pizza this friday once i get my paycheck.  thank you

[] family of newly five fresh out of the hospital would love a pizza. on sept 30th our baby boy ezra was born and unexpectedly had a long nicu stay in a hospital over an hour away from our home... and that really drained our account.  we have two other kids, and my husband being out of work for so long while i stayed to breastfeed the new baby in the nicu unit made money even tighter, and on top of everything else, we got a speeding ticket heading to the hospital initially to have him, no joke!  he sure is cute though and worth all we went through a million times over: http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9149/ezra016.jpg

today my husband texted me twice from work that he is depressed.  he totally forgot he missed his certification test (that we had to pay for!) this morning because he was doing his defensive driving course online for 6 hours and had too much on his mind.  then his watch broke at work :(  he won't be home for another hour and i feel so bad for him, he is really feeling down on himself since we are so short on money and everything has gone so wrong.  a pizza would really cheer him (and our 2 toddlers!) up.  even our german shepherd would appreciate the scrap pizza crust - poor girl has been here by herself a lot lately. i would appreciate it so much, and we would gladly post a picture upon receipt to show our appreciation.  we live in texas, and pizza hut sounds heavingly.

[] (uk) i'm a final year student, i just spent my last £20 on train tickets to a job interview. i've been pretty much struggling with money this year, my already small loan was reduced, the money i had saved from summer didn't go far as a lot of it had to step in to cover the shortfall in my rent and the part time job market sucks.

so toward the end of this year i've been selling stuff to make ends meet. i sold an effects pedal last week for £30 thinking i would budget £10 a week for food to last me.

now i get an interview for a job back in my home town and i had to spend the next 2 weeks food money on tickets to go to it. i've got rice, butter and frozen peas, but i'd sure like something more substantial if a redditor was kind enough to help a brother out?

i've been following reddit for awhile now because of my boyfriend, so even though my account is new i've been a lurker on this website for a few months now. he's actually the one who suggested i try reddit because he's at work and can't be much help atm :] 

anything would be appreciated guys!

(and as much as i love this sub reddit, i feel so guilty using it ;___; )

[]today is my due date for my baby boy! please send me gluten-free pizza?. so after 40 weeks, it's finally here!  baby boy should be making an appearance some time in the next week!  (this is our first) i am showing pretty much no pre-labor signs, except for being a little crampy and irritable, last night i had about 5 braxton hicks contractions.  my fiance is working all day and we unfortunately are living paycheck to paycheck (which is a bit easier when i am actually able to work) and have every penny pinched for the baby.  i am crazy craving some pizza,  i have a bad gluten intolerance (almost had to be hospitalized the last time i ate normal pizza, it was the last glutenous thing i purposefully ate before i made the switch to gluten free everything), so i know that makes it a bit more difficult (and expensive :( ), but i do live in portland, or so there are a couple of gluten free places (like hot lips or bellagios) that do deliver.  i would love you forever and ever and ever and i could craft you something if you'd like.  i haven't had many cravings this entire pregnancy (except meat, i was vegetarian before i got pregnant, now i am a carnivore) and now it is pizza overload.  someone help a pregnant girl (who is not royal by any means) out?

[] been hungry for weeks. "guest", eat everything and haven't left after being told they need to leave.. so here's my story of why i'm here and why i'm so hungry.

7 weeks ago my dad said his friend was moving in because she needed a place to stay. she arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. my dad never cooks and this is fine because i'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. but i've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when i asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. friends of my dads from tennessee. they were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. when i asked my dad if i could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. it feels like it's been forever and they are still here. there's almost nothing i can make to eat besides ramen and corn. the only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which i can't eat because it's for her "diet", and baby food.

what i've been doing is just going out and eating but i quit my last job and began to work with my father. it was hard work and good pay but we live in florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. like i said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme i can eat. i really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than i am. if you can't and decide to help me out i will love you!

thanks for reading and i'll answer any questions.

tl;dr: guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. haven't left after being asked to. i'm terrible at writing.

[] for a pizza in scotland.. hi, not something i have done ever, but here it goes.

i got done with my exams 2 weeks ago and wasn't able to work as much as i would have wanted to during this past 30 days, after paying off my rent all my bills, i have just been left enough money for the bus fare to and from work for the next week and i can't spend that, i've got some rice and bread and pb and stuff, but that's only enough to last me a few days, so i was wondering if anyone could buy me a papa johns? that would be a nice fulfilling meal for a change.

since i get paid in 8 days, i.e next friday, i promise to pass the pizza love to someone who need's it like i do now, i guess that's the whole point of this subreddit.

anyway, thanks for reading.

[] tomorrow (june 30th) is a friends birthday and i can't afford to get him anything. he's having a few friends over and it would be awesome to get some birthday pizza! (london, on, can). hello fellow redditors. i will be very honest, i am one of the people who have come here after seeing the media coverage. well i have been here before, but mostly just lurking. i haven't been able to afford much for myself lately, so that's why i haven't really participated much here, but it is something i plan on doing once i get some more funds in the bank account.

so here's my story. tomorrow is one of my really good friends 23rd birthday. it's been a rough year so far for both of us (both had breakups around the same time) and since then, our friendship has really become a lot stronger. i've been in the negatives in my bank account the last two weeks and i can't afford to get him anything for his birthday (it's a byob party and i don't even have any b to b) he's having about 6 or so people over tomorrow to celebrate and i think it would be awesome if we could get some birthday pizza for the party. i know there's a lot of people out there who would better benifit from pizza, but this would mean a whole lot to me if someone could help me out tomorrow evening. i'll pay it forward when i can afford!

() my daughter &amp; son &amp; i would love a little helping hand. hi reddit,

before you all jump on me for being a new member, i hope you will take the chance to read my plea.  yes, i'm new to the community, no i didn't hear about it through the news reports the other day, but rather heard about it from a family friend.  

in the past month, my life has essentially fallen apart.  my wife of 15 years has all but thrown in the towel to our marriage.  she has moved back in with her parents, and i'm living in our house with our two children, jennifer &amp; william.  along with this added stress, i've just lost my job as a management consultant.  so now i'm left with a broken heart, a hole in my pocket and two hungry kids to feed.

we're not in as terrible of a position as other members on here, but i was wondering if a kind member would be willing to donate a pizza so i can surprise my kids at some point, and hopefully help them get their minds off our current situation. 

thank you all so much for even reading this.

our total amount of bills almost doubled because of this new one.  my girlfriend has been a bit stressed of late, as have i, because it's increasingly looking like one of us(if not both) is going to have to take on a second job, or the eviction fairy shall be making it's rounds.  we have enough food for maybe one meal, and the nearest payday is next week.  it would be a great stress reliever, and an overall solid evening if me and my girlfriend could share a pizza tonight.  

it would be double the awesome, because her absolute favorite food is pizza, and seems skeptical of this entire community(reddit all together, not just raop). if one of you fine redditors could show us the way to pizza goodness, not only will you have the good karma, and satisfaction of helping a hard working college grad out, i'll also get my girlfriend to draw you a rad picture!  win, win in my book.

[] having a down day, stressed. can i get a pizza? (austin, tx). been out of work, had a job interview today... didn't go so well. it was for a translation job basically, got there and found out the hard way that they are only seeking someone who can read traditional chinese fluently.

i only read simplified chinese. whoops. i walked in, felt really good, but then that happened... just feel kinda dumb. didn't even let me speak to an interviewer or anything, threw my papers from the translation test away xd.

can i get a pizza? i was counting on getting a free one from domino's but they ended that promo and now i'm screwed xd. pizza or no, any cheerful comments would be appreciated as well :)
[] northeast pennsylvania, usa. hoping to have some pizza tonight.. hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. been going through some rough times lately. my mother passed exactly a year ago this week (february 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly i cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much i miss her, but i'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and i'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. ana and i couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. i'm not sure why he is the way he is, but i think it has something to do with his mother. when i was 12 i was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. so i'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. he started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then i decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a "dick"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, bad move. i don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. he slammed the door open, knocking over ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. he grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. this was her idea. then she gave me the best advice i have ever gotten concerning my father. leave. leave and never look back. he is not safe to be around. he is not a good person. so to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. i'm not sure if this was all tmi but i really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like i'm actually worth caring about. if you've read this far, thank you so much.

but alas! some good news! we both just landed new jobs yesterday. we both got hired as sales people at sears... i know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. i'm an it guy, actually i'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but i also have worked it jobs. we do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. we don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. in fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. so clearly there is no money for pizza. which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. if someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! here's a picture of me and him: ([horatio and bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohdji.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([ana](http://i.imgur.com/qhmzl.jpg)) . anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. she's actually at orientation right now and i've got online training to do. thank god we still have the internet! we're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily reddit fix. sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. we love you all.

.

ps: when we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward. today you, tomorrow me.

[] looking to put the wife in the holiday groove after a hard week, phoenix, arizona. my job barely pays the bills, my food budget for the week is spent, and she's been putting extra hours in at her new retail job... so she can buy/ship all 5 of her sisters(plus parents, grandparents, ect) christmas gifts this year since we live in a different state and won't be able to get together like they do every year.

even if it's just a simple $5 little caesar's it would make her day to be able to be able to 'eat out' instead of the same meals i cook(she works  evenings) day in and out :p

[] chicago, il - check lost in the mail, $0.25 in the bank account, and out of ramen. hey there.

i've been struggling the past few months but this week has been a little rougher than most.  a check i was expecting from a temp job i had worked was lost in the mail and it sounds like i won't receive the reissued one until later this week or early next week.  my bank account is looking real sad right now and i've used up the last bit of my spare change to cover transit fare.  i've been eating a lot of rice and ramen but some pizza would be really nice if anyone could help.

thanks for reading :)
[]no money until wednesday. hello reddit, 

i won't be getting any money until wednesday and our fridge is bare. my wife and i would really appreciate a pizza if possible. i know others might need it more, but if possible we would really appreciate it. as soon as i land a job (2 prospects in the works) i would love to pay it forward of course. anything to get a slice next to my name :p jk

thanks reddit and redditors for all the laughs.

many thanks pizza givers!
[] car needed repairs, could use pizza - brisbane, australia. hey guys, after a long week at work i could really use a pizza. i had to get my car fixed this week and it ate up all my monies except for enough to get to work for the next week. i know there probably isn't many australians on here but it's worth a try. worst thing about being broke? missing nirvana live at the paramount at the cinema for its only screening to mark the 20th anniversary of nevermind.
[] pizza for my lover. i lost my job, maybe someone would help a couple out?
[] my birthday yesterday was a disappointment, could use a pie to cheer me up :(. things didn't go quite as planned and i ended up watching my bf play video games all night in a friend's basement along with the privilege of being dd for the hour-long drive home. i'd just like to feel a bit special, even if it's a day late. 
[] student intern in nyc. i moved to nyc for the summer in order to complete an digital effects internship and am currently working that and 2 other jobs waiting tables/bar backing in order to stay afloat. this city has been tearing me apart financially on top of my college loans and i would greatly appreciate the help of roap to help fill my belly with delicious pizza as opposed to the ramen noodles and cheese sandwiches i've become accustom to. 
[] haven't been on in awhile... could use a pizza :) . it's just me tonight.. my kiddos are gone for the night and i would really like to enjoy a pizza i haven't been on in awhile due to very rude people so i'm just asking if you are not gonna say anything nice and you only want to talk negative then pass this up and don't post because you are wasting your time being negative. no sob story or nothing just hungry with a night to myself. thanks raop!! :)
() first thanksgiving by myself, ain't got a thing to cook and of coarse i'm broke like a stone. athens georgia.. my names marcus and i live in georgia. basically i got uninvited to a dinner party tomorrow and i'm stuck out of luck in the food department until sunday. i got some tuna but no bread or mayo, 2 cans of chef boyardee, a few hamburger pattys but no buns, and a can of black beans. that's the literal contents of my fridge and pantry, and while it's better than nothing at all like some folks have i'm a little less than thankful this year.

my mom died last year and i'm still paying out of pocket to get everything situated with that. if i have any other family i don't know them so spending the holidays with anyone is out of the question. my girlfriend went up to tennessee but i couldn't get off work so eating with her family is out of the question. and my best friend of over three years told me flat out today his wife doesn't want me to come because her parents are going to be there. so for the first time in my life i'm completely alone on turkey day and it's depressing the heck out of me.

so yeah, no family or friends or money means no black olives, turkey, gravy, those little marshmallows, etc for me tomorrow. any way i could score some pizza money today so i can get some wings or something? i'd much rather warm something up tomorrow than eat a can of plain tuna or some lousy canned spaghetti. thanks for any help or well wishes you might offer.
[] parents leaving for a bit, but i have to save all of my money for gas to go see my girlfriend for my birthday this saturday. i have a part time job but pizza hut (ironic?) corporate is forcing our store to give less and less hours; i only got around 13 this week. so any offers with pizza hut and i get a 20% discount (i think so, they took our 50% break discount so i don't know if i still get the 20% one). to see my girlfriend costs 150 dollars in gas to pick up and drop her off back at her house. kinda want the cheesy bites pizza because my co-workers get pissed off every time someone orders one! xd seriously though they are a huge pain to make...oh! i also have to save all of my money because i may be homeless/living in my girlfriends closet soon... :(

edit: i should add today has been a really depressing day, and frozen chicken isn't exactly comfort food

edit2: i actually don't like pizza hut pizza all that much, at least not compared to dominos

any pizza would be appreciated!
[] rhode island, usa. just moved into a new apartment with a teething baby.. i have just about zero in the way of extra cash, recently shelled out a bunch to move, but cooking just seems like the most daunting task in the world right now with the kiddo so miserable.

i just need me a bacon and pineapple pizza to curl up with on the couch while i nurse the baby into a milk coma.  
() us, ky. i'm sick, fridge is empty, mom works from 4 am to 6pm and doesn't get paid for another week and a half.. i don't like asking for things (hence me using a side account), but my mom and i could really use some food. i haven't been able to find a job, and she works ultra hard, but w/o child support we can't even pay rent. i think the only thing we have to eat is some canned pineapples. if you want proof i'm an active redditor and not just a beggar, i'll send a screen shot of me logged into my real account or w/e. i just don't want my friends to know about my situation. thank you for this wonderful website! (sorry i don't have any cats.)

[] poor students, tried to make pizza, only available toppings were stir fry paste and frosties, help. http://imgur.com/z1be3
we cannot afford further toppings and thought better of going through with the chili, basil and frosties combination. please would you buy us pizza, made by a professional with the correct materials.
[] unknowingly ate week old bad lasagna because it was the only food. could use a real meal to settle my stomach.. out of work right now. looking for a new job. got home last night, ate lasagna, went to bed and woke up puking into my trashcan around 4 hours later. i've spent all day in bed feeling like shit instead of out applying at places. i only have 200 bucks in my account and i have no idea how long that'll have to last me. i'd be willing to repay the favor with my first paycheck.

because i live in a guest house dominos is a must. the pizza tracker tells me when to expect delivery and go to the main house, meaning i can wait in bed while it's cooking.
[] story of pizza and love. hello roap! i just want to go into a small amount of detail in this post and tell you guys how much we're in love. i will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail i'll be going in to.


i was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. we're a new couple, so of course i'm trying to look cool in front of her so i say something along the lines of "alright, if you really want to," when really i wanted to shout at the top of my excitement "are you sure it's you're birthday and not mine because i love the arcade, wooooo--"


so we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and anyway, we're having fun.


so she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. i took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. i don't like to go through other peoples texts, but i see the word "tony" before i put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.
so i read just the 1 text. it states:
"tony better remember what you asked for last week."
my stomach got this twisted feeling of "oh crap how could i forget." 


!!!!! 


just then --- a pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so i rush him and scream "hey wait!". i ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. i asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, i wasn't paying attention at the time.)


i took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. next, i took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and i start singing happy birthday. people around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.


she has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. she gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said "i thought you forgot!".


she took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. "i will love you until the last pepperoni fades." she starting crying like she just won the lottery.

---- now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and i plan to have dinner with her this evening.


i would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love.
[] soon to have all the pizza i could possibly want but for now...broke. i got a job at dominos recently but they are having trouble getting me through the system and it is taking forever to actually start my training. so if i get a pizza tonight instead of eating pbj i will pay it forward very soon.
[] dfw, tx -- broke and the ramen's all gone.. been living off ramen and beans 'n rice for the past few weeks. ate my last ramen yesterday for lunch. don't have much to offer but i'll do what i can to trade.
[] help put a smile on a saint's face. my father used to order my mother a pepperoni pizza and an order of breadsticks for the two of them to share (my younger brother and i would have our own). he included a special request to have the pepperonis arranged in a smile and would personally place 2 breadsticks on the pizza to give it a mustache. 

this always put a smile on her face. my younger brother has autism and my mother has multiple sclerosis but has still been working her ass of through the pain.

she lost her job at the end of last august and a month later my father passed away. i just got off the phone with her and she was holding back tears. i really want to make her smile by bringing back some of the good memories of my father and reminding her that there is good in the world.

i do not have a credit card and only have $4 in my bank. i would really like to send her a smiley-face pizza. can anyone help me put a smile on the most wonderful woman in the world's face?

i promise to pay it forward as soon as i have the funds.

() a random pizza would be great...(florida). on 07/17/11 at 11:30 my wifey and i became parents for the first time.  we were not in great financial standing to begin with, but i have done everything i could over the last few months to buy things to have us ready for the baby, and everything is doing great there.

however, wifey is already starting to feel the post-partum depression setting in.  she feels like we will never be able to enjoy life again because money is a little tight right now.  we both have jobs, etc. so things will be better.  however the tastiest food we have had is hamburger helper made with 70/30 beef in the past week and a half.

and so, a random pizza would be great...

tl;dr new baby, the mother is depressed because we are eating out of cans already, trying to lift her spirits.

can provide proof of everything above.

[] avoided an accident, missed an exam, would love to stress eat some cheesy goodness! (md). so i've been studying for a test all morning and finally felt confident that i was going to get a good grade. so i get in my car to drive to class, get onto the highway, start going about 60mph...and my front tire pops. 

i honestly do not know how i didn't get in an accident. it was really terrifying. so, now all of my money will be going towards buying new tires. i also missed my test :( 

i hate having a sob story but i would seriously love some pizza to celebrate not being injured/dead. thanks for reading! 
[usa] [] one pizza, with extra love?.... starving college student who's eaten frozen fish-sticks for the past few days and just looking for a good meal!

in return, when money is available to me, i will buy the person a pizza.
[req] just found out about this place, figured i might as well ask.. well, i do tech support here in fayetteville, nc. i got sick a couple of weeks ago and had to go to the doc. i don't have insurance yet, so that tapped out my savings, to start. it also got slow at work, which meant i had to leave early several days in a row.

i just barely made rent. i had 5 bucks left to go grocery shopping on. i bought a 10lb bag of rice and some flavorings (pizza sauce, soy sauce, salsa that was on sale) and have been eating that for the last week. at this point, i just want something with some flavor. i get paid on the 20th, and would love to buy a pizza or two then for someone.

just figured i would ask. it may work, it may not. never know.
[, st. catharines, ontario] my freezer shut off in the middle of the night.. i hope i'm doing this right, it feels really weird asking for something, but it would really make me feel better. i'm in university and i'm really broke, my rent and groceries cleaned me out earlier this week and last night my freezer turned off and spoiled all of my newly bought groceries. i tried to make pizza for lunch with toast and tomato sauce but it turned out pretty shitty.

++warning, the link has very loud background music, turn speakers down++
[this](http://www.twicethedealpizza.com) is where my room-mates and i normally get our pizza since it's the cheapest place in town, we normally get the "godzilla deal" two xl pizzas with 3 toppings for 20 bucks and normally get onions, tomatoes and bacon.

[] my truck got stollen last night!!. so my truck was stollen from my car port last night :(. an 88 toyota pickup. why anyone would want it is a mystery to me. probably just stoll it for parts and tires. anyhoo, it's shitty and i think a nice pizza would cheer me up and make the research i need to do to find a new (new to me :)) vehicle a little easier to deal with. 
[] it's been a tough month and being away from the family sucks, especially now. hungry :(. i recently moved out to az from lv and well... my story consists of heartbreak, pawning of items, and basically picking myself up from the ground.

i'll be more than glad to share my story, but honestly i could use a pizza. i've got no money for dinner and i've been making due with some ramen but yeah...it'd be nice to have a pizza.

i'm usually on the other end of this but this time i could really use the help.
[]i'm on the stress and poverty diet, but it's my cheat day.. i'm lucky that internet comes part and parcel with my rent. i work retail grocery and summer hours are murder on the wallet. i have to hustle managers just to get a good 20-25 hours a week, when i used to push the part time hour limit. 

i hate begging, but my stomach is scoffing at me and calling me a proud asshole. so here i am :). just one is all i ask.
[] indiana, usa would love some pizza for what seems to be a very busy work day.. i've recently been put on a rather large project from my employer. combine that with trying to learn some light web development and trying to improve my understanding of xhtml and css 3.0, and i am put in a position where it seems like i have no free time. money has been tight, so while i have a budget that keeps me fed, it's mostly just rice and other odd little things that don't cost a whole lot. i think if someone were awesome enough to gift me a pizza right now, it would help me stay sane right now. :)

would certainly pizza it forward after this large project is done near the middle of the month (right before christmas it seems).

would also be willing to assist someone in simple or perhaps slightly complicated html/css work if requested. i'm sure i can find a little bit of time to answer questions or give advice. that's pretty much my forte. just don't ask me about jquery. that seems to be my kryptonite!
[] new york city just arrived back home from school and would love some pizza tonight.. no sad story or anything, just a broke college student (i have a part time job but most of the money goes to paying rent/food and paying down student loans early) who would love some pizza for dinner tonight. it is either the pizza or cheerios with no milk for dinner. help me out with either papa johns or dominos.

if someone gives me a papajohns gift card, i will use code that gives you the free pizza with an order of $10 and pay it forward in this subreddit tomorrow night!

thank you!!!
[] would really appreciate a pizza for myself, my friend and her son!!!. my friend has helped me with a place to stay and food until i get on my feet and she is having a difficult time herself as a single mother of 1. she didn't need to help me out but after my daughter had open heart surgery i lost everything and after being homeless and hungry for the last 8 months her helping me recently is helping me get my whole life back on track.  she doesn't have much but still is giving and got me out of the homeless shelter!

we do have food so if there's anyone going without please help them.  if there's more to go around we sure could use it and i know her and her son would be very grateful!  thanks!
[] pizza around the nj area?. i am an out of work phlebotomist struggling to get by at the moment while i find another hospital to work at.  the bills are piling up and i have no money to pay them.  what bothers me the most about my situation is that my boyfriend, who is super patient and cooperative with me while i'm losing my mind trying to find a job, helps me however i need to whether it is financial or a simple hug at the end of his long day to cheer me up a bit.  i am very upset that i lost my independence...

my boyfriend has been on a diet (keto) for a few months, and he has decided that he is going to have a "cheat day" on his birthday which is in a few days. he has been my rock through these long months and i have nothing to give to him and no money to buy him a gift or even cook him something for his cheat day.  he has done so much for me and all i want to do is give something back to him.  if there is anyone out there that can help me out on his birthday, i'd be so happy!  even if i can't get a proper gift for him, i think pizza on one of his cheat days should suffice :)

once i get back on my feet, i am going to send a pizza to some lovely redditors to return the kindness.  
[] finals, drexel university. drexel university is almost done with finals week
and i think a great reward for all the students pulling

[]help this ohio couple with 3 kids brighten their day. . short version of my sob story:  we receive food stamps (husband laid off, both of us also working on our bachelors degrees) which honestly keeps us through the month pretty well.  food stamp card broke in half and can't find a store to honor it.  we ordered a new card but it won't be here for 7-10 business days. out of pretty much everything but can visit a food pantry day monday to make ends meet. right now things are bleak. 

i have a hidden bag a marshmallows in  the back of the cupboard and some wood in the back yard - would love a pizza lunch/dinner and then surprise them with some flaming 'mellows.

[] fresno, ca friend's uncle committed suicide would like to give him some guy time complete with pizza, beer, and halo. one of my close friends is in need of some guy time, his family moved back east and after his uncle committed suicide last week he's been a little torn up (he had to go to the funeral alone). i would like to give him some solid man grieving time. a friend gave me some beer from a party he threw last week but if someone could give me a coupon to papa johns i promise to do the same next month.

i'm running short this month due to some legal fees i had to pay and some of the extra money i make as a contractor won't get into my bank account till the end of the month. all in all this is just shitty timing.
does anyone do fun s? -- will do what is most upvoted, for a pizza. -- (need a sponsor). title says it all.

been reading this subreddit for a little while. noticed some fun offers. what about fun requests?

i will either do whatever gets the most upvotes. or if i can't, i will surrender, and let you pass the pizza on to someone else.

**pizza sponsor can be different from the suggesters**

this could be fun.

[] veggie pizza for in debt couple paying medical bills in austin, tx. hi,
i had surgery three months ago to reconstruct my acl and meniscus. because of the physical nature of my job i have been unable to work for the past three months although i have started back up this week past week so hooray for that. we do have insurance to pay much of the bills for which i am thankful, but the bills we have had to pay have wiped us out and put us in debt. no money in the bank account until friday when my husband gets paid and in the meantime no food in the pantry but rice and beans which we've been eating every single night this week.
i've never asked for assistance before and feel slightly unworthy when there are people with no food in their pantry out there. still, if anyone can spare us a pizza tonight we'd be very grateful. we're vegetarians so please no meat. i will be happy to pay the pizza forward next month when i get my first paycheck.
thank you.

thanks, guys.

[] memphis, tn. if it can't unlock my car, i'll just eat it.. dreamin' of a pizza, waiting for a locksmith.

it's been a long day. a long groovy day, save for a moment of brilliance wherein i bravely locked my keys securely away in my vehicle. i was startled by a child with a airsoft pain inflictor; instinct demanded i slam the door shut and turn to face the culprit. i am a smart, brave man.

anyway, evening plans are kinda shot now. i'm chilling out, waiting for a locksmith, hoping it won't eradicate the funds i need to float on blissfully towards that next paycheck.

[] broke college sophomore alone during fall recess. campus dining locations are closed for the night. willing to create custom art in exchange for pizza. westminster, md. sup raop?

i'm chilling in my room, listening to some music and browsing reddit. suddenly i get hungry, and go to the campus pub for a meatball sub and some fries. unfortunately, due to the lower quantity of students on campus this weekend (we have a four-day weekend this week and almost everyone has gone home,) the pub's hours are different, and when i got there they were already closed. goddamnit.

anyway, the first thing that popped into my mind, of course, was "reddit," and getting back to my room, the first thing i do is jump onto my computer and go right to raop. now, i'm sitting here, pretty damn hungry, listening to ensiferum and wondering what i can do to get some delicious pizza in my belly. so here's my offer. i am willing to provide a custom funny drawing of the giver's choice in exchange for a pizza. i'm not looking for anything extravagant as far as the pizza goes, and we have a cheap local place that delivers until midnight. in exchange for said pizza, you receive said drawing. the only other food i have right now is martin's salt and vinegar potato chips, and while they are delicious, they simply aren't much of a meal. please help this broke sophomore get himself some 'zza?

help me random acts of pizza, you're my only hope!

[montreal,qc]. will return the favor to a random person on reddit 
[] ontario, canada - on my 3rd of 5 days without food, and it's getting unbearable. can anyone help?. i'm not in college, or a starving artist or anything like that. i've just been a bit unlucky lately. i'm a 36 year old single guy with a job. but rent, and other bills killed me this month. i thought i had enough funds in my account to at least keep me set with mr. noodles, i forgot about my monthly banking fee.

i had a small bag of chips wednesday afternoon, and i get paid monday, so i'll be fine then.. it's just really painful at this point and food is something i'm constantly thinking about.

i've got a few bucks to get on the bus to work on saturday, so i can't really use that.

i'm really embarrassed to even be asking like this and i'm not sure how it works, so please be patient with me.

i guess that covers it. thank you in advance.

cheers folks.
 - i want pizza. i could give you some sob story, but really i'm just poor and hungry. but welcome to my life as a broke college student. 
() hungry and waiting on payday in baltimore. my husband is not able to find a job and i am working at a job with very few hours just trying to make ends meet until next payday and failed this week. please help if you can if not thakyou for reading anyway and god bless.
[] would anyone like to trade a pizza hut egiftcard for a domino's one?. for some weird reason the pizza hut in my area doesn't let you use your egiftcard through the online website-- they make you go there in person to do it. i am sick and have no car, and the bus doesn't run on weekends, so...

would anyone like to trade? 
[] my girlfriend is soo hungry she won't stop complaining about it and i'm like shit i don't know how to cook and whatnot. please can i have it. thx bros
[] oklahoma here: i'd love a pizza after this week, please.. this has been a hard week. i don't want to bore you with details, but i'd like to smile and believe there's still good people willing to do good things. i'd love to pay it forward after friday. thank you.
[] madison, wi - big family would like some pizza for tonight. hi everyone,

[] esparto, ca, usa: would love to relax with a pizza.. struggling to find employment. would love a pepperoni pizza.
[] stuck at work in stl. hi! i don't consider myself particularly destitute, but some delivery, be it pizza or whatever else, would certainly be appreciated tonight. story and circumstance below.

---

i work at one of my school's it help desks. it's our fall break, and i'm here alone from 2p-10p central. normally, i'd get a lunch break, but as i'm the only one here (no supervisor, or anything), and i don't have a key, i can't leave the office.

delivery is fine, but i'm running low on cash until payday. a tight spot to be in this week, but i'm usually ok. when i get off, there will be campus food i can get, so it's really a matter of making it til 10pm.

---

anything else you'd like to know, please let me know. thanks for even reading =)

i was helped out by a friend =) thanks all, and happy pizza 
[] hungry folks sitting at home. hey, we have a house full of hungry people here. the only money we have coming in at the moment is unemployment and, we don't get paid until tomorrow. if someone wanted to hook us up with some pizza that would be great.
[] nyc usa had a rough couple days, pizza would cure all!. hey citizens of random_acts_of_pizza!  nyc-based actor/ retail drone, broke (overdrafted at the moment) until paycheck deposits tomorrow.  caught a weird head cold this week (better now!) and missed some shifts at work, had some family drama, and dealing with this awful heat and humidity. a sensible pizza could get me fed and happy until i can get paid and to the grocery store tomorrow. i can only eat so much cous cous in one weekend!

i've never posted here before - but i fully intend to "pizza-it-forward" when i'm back on my feet a bit more.  happy june, everyone! 

edit: added some more info!
[] dallas tx could really enjoy a nice and hot pizza. job on the fence :/. found out today that i could quite possibly be losing my job due to restructuring within the company. dealt with some relationship issues as well that didn't go so hot. snapped at my mom- had no intentions of doing so. 

could really use a pizza and coke.
[] texas, usa. broke college student studying for finals would greatly appreciate a pie!. as the title says, i'm a pretty broke college student (at least until my tax return check comes in) and in the middle of finals week studying. a nice pizza would definitely the all-nighter i'm about to pull. i'm willing to provide any info you need via pm. 
[] arkansas; that feeling when you run out of ramen.... i don't get paid until next friday, and the last packet of ramen was used for dinner a few nights ago. i've got pickle juice and mayonnaise in the refrigerator and i'm not sure even sure if the mayo is any good... a hot meal would be majorly appreciated.

edit: i forgot to mention that when i get paid, i'll return the favour. it'll just be a week.
[] roommates left me no move-out notice so now i have to front the whole rent myself, and am completely broke until my next paycheck. please feed me!. i'll be sure to pay it forward! this month is just really hard because my roommates moved out right before rent is due and i had to buy a bunch of things to get by (they--a couple--took everything we originally split the cost of, so i have no dishes or utensils, cookware, etc.) until i find a place w/ my soon-to-be new roommates. and i don't make nearly enough at my minimum-wage job to afford rent by myself (college student!) so i already had to borrow $500 to cover part of my rent from my parents. they're really broke too.

luckily i just got a second job and have been working my butt of at my current one, so once i'm well budgeted again, i'll be more than happy to pay the deed forward!

[] two guys who don't get paid for a few more days without any food.. me and my friend are house/pet sitting and the owners left no food. we don't get paid for a few more days and a nice hot pizza would mean the world to us. we will definitely do an offer once we get paid. please pm me! thank you!!
[] extreamly broke and hungry. just started new job. . just started a new job but all my remaining money was put into my gas tank. just need some food to get me through until payday. you would be helping out a military member in need. =) please and thank you!
[] part want, part need. (mn). this past week at work, i fell off an office chair that was missing a bolt and ended up having to get a tetanus shot and 6 x-rays. i'm living from paycheck to paycheck, so i'm eating meagerly as it is, and the lost wages from the work i had to miss mean even less food from this next one, though still enough to get by. also, i've been in a lot of pain, which has made it a really shitty week. a pizza would do wonders to improve it.

note: i looked into worker's comp, which doesn't start compensating for lost wages until you've missed three days of work. i wasn't gone for three days because i just got a new second part-time job and didn't want to miss more than a day for fear of losing it.
[](miami, fl) student studying, freezing and hungry. hey guys, i'm curled up in my dorm studying for finals. it's also freezing cold because my roommate can't fall asleep unless it's freezing. he finished his exams though and gets to sleep in, i'm sure he has a massive hangover. 

as any college student, money is tight, and it's hard to actually have a heart warming meal. i usually just rely on hot dogs without buns and ramen. 

of course there are people that are more than me, and please, help them first. i'm not going to die, nor do i have 5 kids, just a college student. thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy your weekend!

[] my girlfriend and i could use a nice pizza dinner. we're planning a move across the country in about 3 weeks. we've got some money saved for the trip and getting set up out there, but we're pretty limited on funds now. any pizza would be greatly appreciated. we're both hungry and any scraps will be fed to our two cats, who just happen to love pizza too.

[] poor college student, hungry.. like the title says, i'm a poor college student practically starving. i've been eating some bootlegged cinnamon toast crunch cereal for about 5 days now, 3 times a day. just today, i filled up what would be my last bowl to be ready to end the day. of course, something happened, i found a beetle on my cereal, i had taken multiple spoonfuls at this point and didn't notice it. did i mention i was terrified and grossed out of bugs? my only option was to through out the cereal, it took me some guts to even drink the milk at the end. (didn't want to waste it) i live with my parents, and i have to drive a 1989 lincoln town car to college every day. i can barely afford to pay for the gas every 5 days to go to and from school. all in all i'm starving, trying to finish my homework for the day. some pizza would be awesome at this point.

[]  mom of 3 great kids in fl could use a helping hand. i am embarrassed to ask...but i started a new job a week ago (no paycheck for two weeks) and my kids have been eating rice for three days.  they have been far more understanding than they had to be.  i would really love to give them something special tonight (but i cannot).  if any one could help save them from yet another night of white rice, i would be most grateful.   and would love to pay it forward when i get paid next week! 
[] just found out i completely tore a ligament in my ankle, and got fired from my new job as a result. ive got $10 to make it through the weekend, and i could really use a hot meal and some cheering up. /:. im a rugby player, and im due to start my last season for my college team in a month. sprained my ankle in july playing soccer, just got an mri due to the persistant pain, and found out i shredded a ligament. its possibly surgical, and when i told my new boss, he said hed have to let me go because im on crutches and im 'a risky investment.' i had just paid my rent with the last of my savings yesterday before my doctors appointment, and i have $10 till tuesday [also my birthday]. just a little bummed and hungry--id really appreciate a meal, and id be happy to provide any sort of verification needed. thanks for reading. 
[] lost my job at pizza hut recently, broke and hungry now. i lost my job at pizza hut a little while ago, haven't had any luck finding a new job so far, now i'm out of money, hungry, and craving some non pizza hut pizza to spite my former employer! would be very much appreciated.

[] mckees rocks, pa could really go for a pizza. i lost my job a few weeks ago and also just ended a very bad engagement. i am a single mom with 3 kids and we really would like pizza but i have no money until my unemployment starts. if anyone could help us out it would be great.
[] indiana, college student, just broke my foot. no car, hard to get around. would love a pizza.. when i have the means i *will* pay it forward.
[] i'd like to experience the taste of free pizza once (i'll pay it forward). hello redditors, 
have you ever received something for free? did you remember how good that felt, just because "hey, free stuff" ? well, i hadn't had that feeling in a while and i just want to experience it. i know the power of the internet would blow my wife's mind and my daughter would think i'm a magician. honestly, it's not about the money, i'll pay the pizza forward to another random redditor or back to yourself(today you, tomorrow me), it's just for science , to know if free pizza really does taste better. 
[]my dogs would be happy if you could offer me and my wife some pizza. the one part time job between the two of us pays the rent, but not the pizza.(verified). i know, no one likes a sob story, but any offers would be appreciated by us. [here's a picture of our dogs expressing gratitude.](http://i.imgur.com/ydimk.jpg) i followed all the instructions on the side bar so, i guess i'm verified.

i don't know if this helps but i haven't put on any clothes yet (been applying for jobs *online* all morning), and my wife says "do you think being nude asking for pizza will make you more successful?" what do you think reddit? will it? (i hope it doesn't do the opposite.)

[] carbondale, il sitting here after a long day at work, and would love to have dinner tonight and breakfast for tomorrow. can anyone help a brother out?. the toppings do not matter to me. i will eat almost anything.
[] willing to trade art for pizza! houston, tx. i have a bunch of 11"x17" poster prints and high resolution jpg's of cool art to trade for a pizza! all pieces were originally painted by me! i have no cash on me and dont get paid till tomorrow. i'll give samples to an offerer. 
[] cedar park, tx: i'll gladly pizza you friday for a pizza today.. alright reddit, i'll be straight. i'm not super desperate for food. if someone else says they're on their last legs and need a pie, go take care of them first. by the time i get paid i will definitely not be starving or any such thing. but a man can only sustain on 20 cent ramen for so long before he goes crazy.

money's friday. you do me a solid on this, reddit, and i'll soon reciprocate with a delicious start to your weekend.

e-gifts would be preferred (if i am allowed to say?). thanks ttyl.
 for random act of pizza. i spent some time reading this site before i decided to join and ask and apparently it is not polite to join just to ask for a pizza but i really could use one.  im pregnant from a man who does not care about me's baby.  i guess i was just his toy till he found a new one.  my son josh is 3.  im still young and i know i have my whole life ahead of me but that life looks pretty grim right now if you ask me.  oh and to top if off my parents are drug addicts.  now i am pretty sure a pizza is not going to help me situation but i am hungry right now so if someone feels like being generous that would be great!
[] jersey shore, pa every day is a gift, one to enjoy with a pizza. tbh, i never knew this was here on reddit, but imho only, that information came at the perfect time.. 2 years and 16 days ago i was hit from behind on my cycle at a stop sign. the er doctor told me that if i had been wearing a helmet, the force of impact was so great, i would have been killed on the spot. (extra weight (avg 4-6 lbs.) of the helmet would have caused my neck to snap and kill me)

joining reddit was one of the many things suggest to me, to help re-train my brain and thought process. to everyone i have talked/debated with, let me take a second here and say thank you. 

but back to the reason for the post, may i kindly ask for a pizza? as it has been a long road back to somewhat normal for me and thinking about someone i don't know, caring enough to say, hey, let's send this guy a pizza just because, well, it is so damn cool. i'm not sure what happens next, but to the person if they decide to say hey i can do that, please know from the bottom of my heart, i am grateful for your kindness and will pay it forward as i get better and hopefully get back to work. james

[] want to feed my little brother and myself...read inside for info. first, this is a throw away account because i don't want my real life friends reading about this.  

my family has gotten by in the past few years through me finding odd jobs and my mothers small income from her job.  it's not much but we get by.  

the reason i'm requesting tonight is because my mom decided to take what money we had saved up to buy food for us for thanksgiving and for the next week so that she could buy alcohol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets.  i'm not sure why she did this but it leaves us with very little food for the week.  all i'm asking for is a pizza or two that could feed my family and i for the next two days until i get paid on wed.  thanks in advance.
[] me and my girlfriend would like something to eat. hello!

we live in sweden - but i've got a paypal account.

i would also be happy to take ideas of how we could earn some money! we're kind of out of ideas :)
(we've tried to "get a job" and we've "sold some stuff")

**edit: i got pizza money from a very nice redditor! will post updates within a few days, when i get the money on my bank account!**
[] (chico,ca) i'd make good use of a dominos pizza. it is a dreadful rainy day in chico, and i have no current means of dry transportation. a hurricane of an empty stomach is howling at me, and the only cure i can think of is some tasty dominos delivery. please help me out, and someday in the future i shall return the favor to another in need of tasty round goodness.
[] pizza for the sleepy. i haven't slept in 2 weeks. i discovered those 5hr energy type drinks and well... i have a ton of work from work and a ton of free lance work. a pizza would cheer me up and i will gladly pay it forward at the end of the month when i get paid.
[] haven't eaten much this week. also very high at the moment.. i moved in with my grandma in seattle who doesn't grocery shop at all and only buys takeout for herself. i'm paying for college and work for not much money and can't afford to buy a lot of food. i ate mostly oatmeal i found in the cupboard for a week. i also got high for the first time in a few months and that's making me extra hungry. so it's a combination of actual hunger with added munchies.
[] unpacking, building forts in the living room with the three kiddos, and doing laundry. just realized we're all hangry.. austin, tx   we get paid friday and i think my kids will attack me if we eat peanut butter or spaghetti one more time. we aren't usually quite this broke but a poorly planned move and we are on our last dimes for two more days. please, sir, may i have some moar pizza?

[] birmingham,uk. would love a pizza. pm me if you wanna be kind :d
[] 20yo uk, the most difficult day of my life over, and a pizza sure would help.. today i just finished telling my mum, dad and my grandad that i am transgender, and i will be starting to transition from male to female. 

my mother was not okay with it. according to her now, i am disowned from the family, and can no longer speak to her, unless i say i am deciding to not transition.

my dad's reaction was so misinformed that i inadvertently lost my cool trying to explain it, where i was then met with a stern 'get out until you figure out that you're not a tra*ny'. 

my mormon grandad however, was not hostile, was not disagreeing, but merely said, "whilst i do not understand it, i'm sure you can help me find out." he accepts what i'm doing and will not hold it against me, and will not treat me differently until i ask. 

i think i figured out where i'm staying for the next few years whilst i finally start on my path to feeling better in myself.

does anyone wanna help round off one of my most difficult days ever, and buy me a pizza? it would seriously help me to calm down and take my mind off the massive dilemmas that have happened.

if you wish to see proof of anything, or just ask me any questions, please do below :)

i'm sorry if i've said anything offensive during this as well, no offense was intended!

[] i'll trade you a laugh for a pizza. so one day two redditors decide they want to start a petting zoo. so one redditor said to the other redditor, "you go out and find the land, i will go out and find the animals." they agree and set off on their ways.

so the redditor out looking for the animals was walking down the street when he sees a roster store. he walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a rooster. they guy says, "okay, but we don't call them roosters, we call thems "cocks". " 

he says, "okay", buys the roster, and sets off on his way.

he continues walking down the street when he sees a chicken store. he walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a chicken. they guy says, "okay, but we don't call them chickens, we call thems "pullits". " 

he says, "okay", buys the chicken, and continues on.

a little while later he is walking down the street when he sees a donkey store. he walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a donkey. they guy says, "okay, but we don't call them donkeys, we call thems "asses", and there is something very peculiar about this ass, you have to scratch his ass every five minutes or he'll die. " 

its the last donkey in the store, so he says, "okay", buys the donkey, and sets off on his way.

so now this redditor is walking down the street, all three animals in his arms when five minutes go by. he gets really frantic, runs up to the first redditor he sees, and says, "*will you grab my cock and pullit, while i scratch my ass*?"

[] for fun, not pity. im asking for a pizza, not because you should feel sorry for me, but because fun to interact with strangers. have you ever thought its strange that people think it is ok to ask for money from total strangers but they think it is too much to ask to get into a personal conversation with people who help them? i think most the people here are have good intentions for giving away pizza and dont need to be treated like a stalker or rapist or whatever. im not going to open up my whole life to you, but i promise more than trivial conversation and interaction.

and i really need this pizza, im saving for college, ive been eating really cheap food lately.

i live in gig harbor, washington

the reason i dont have many posts on reddit is that i am not able to access my old account under the name "arquebus", it says that no email exists for that name, so i dont know how to get it back. i used to post a lot at www.reddit.com/r/programming/ under that name

[] completely broke till saturday, would love pizza for husband and i please!. ~~~i have no income whatsoever, and my husband is on ssi, paying for my rent and his on a fixed income. with bills and rent, we come out with $8 total for the rest of the month. my food card does not come in till the 9th, and we may not have enough food to last until then. a pizza would greatly lift our spirits, and if someone did donate one, once i have an income again we would be glad to do the same in return. we've already been trolled once today, please don't get our hopes down a second time..~~~

[] boyfriend's visiting and had it rough.  pittsburgh pa. hey guys.  this is my first request.  i live in pittsburgh and my boyfriend's visiting for a week.  i haven't seen him since the beginning of may so i'm pretty excited, but here's the situation.

my boyfriend doesn't have a job (i do, but i get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until june 30th).  the only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  he also sprained his ankle on saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  lastly (and i realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to lake erie for a day and a half.  

[following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy polish mothers]

now you may be wondering "what's wrong with the last part" in which i will refer you to the crutches.  yes, i've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  i've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  the thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  also, i'm going to have to tell my bf that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, i'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  i know i should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, i can't change my situation right now so i'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when i told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.

anyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and i'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say "i'm sorry that my mom's crazy and i can't do anything about it."  his house is in oakland so i'd suggest sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.

also, since i'm getting my first paycheck in june 30th, i'll make sure to donate a pizza.  

[] would just like some pizza.. i'm not starving or anything, so if someone else posts with a much more dire situation than me, i'd encourage you to send pizza to them. i'm just hungry and have been craving pizza for the past few days, but haven't had any pocket money. that's all. (:
[] usa -going to be up all night studying on adderal. need food to keep me going!. studying for physiology and anatomy -_- fuck my life.. honolulu
[] (us) family going away, need tasty foodstuffs.. from march 30th to april 1st, all of my nearby family (nuclear and extended), will be having glorious fun times at the beach during spring break, but i can't go because my spring break was 2 weeks ago because i'm in college and they have to be all different and special. when this happened last year, i ate nothing but cottage cheese from the back of the fridge seasoned with tears of loneliness(hyperbole for comedic affect) because i'm shit at cooking dinner(and lazy).

but...

what if there was a glorious community of internet supermen, capable of setting me up with some sort of electronic code, equivalent to some amount of money, with which i could order glorious circles of cheese and bread, preferably from papa johns, and have them delivered to my door by white stallions that shit sparkles?

anyone feeling generous? sparkle-shitting stallions are optional, if that would help.

[] no food until oct.. my mom is broke until oct and i'm 15 and have no job. we have nothing in the fridge/freezer. both of her bank accounts are negative (if you want proof i will happily provide, of course some things will be blurred out) all we want really is a pizza. in the past when i tried to order they don't deliver where we live. (in the mountains) so we could always go and pick up.

[] new jersey, usa. want to celebrate with a good pie. i've been having a couple of harsh months (lung surgery, recovering, severe nerve damage, no money, on disability, etc.). because of the amount of pain i am dealing with i don't get around to much. overall, my dream is to become a pulmonary/critical care specialist to help people like me. i wasn't going to go back to school this semester because of the pain (and not having any money) but i decided this week to still keep pursuing my education. so i got a loan for school and was approved, and classes start next wednesday. i am very excited.

: a pizza would be wonderful - las vegas area.. my boyfriend and i are both college students who survive on financial aid. we have very little money to spend, and don't have the ability to eat out often. though we are not in desperate need, a pizza would be a wonderful gift to brighten our spirits (and a nice change from pre-packaged food). it's hard to have your nose on the grindstone all of the time and not be able to go out for food or fun, but if there are people who need it more, please, help them!
[] please help my friend out with a pizza, she's been through a lot (in ma, usa). . my friend kate is one of the most talented special education teachers i have ever met and is an expert on assistive technology (namely communication devices). she gives voices to many people and has made the lives of countless individuals and their families better through her dedication and relentless work as an educator. she also happens to be the unluckiest person i've ever met - she currently has a broken foot, a uterine tumor, diabetes, a broken car all on top of being broke from student loans and medical expenses. 

she posted a status on facebook tonight that said "at home 3 days with a broken foot, a broken down car and the bank still hasn't sent me a new debit card. anyone who wants to pay to order me a pizza is welcome to, i can't take anymore ramen. on the upside i get new x-rays tomorrow and maybe they can figure out why it hurts so much. and my car should be fixed by noon tomorrow." and i immediately thought of you guys at r/r_a_o_p and hope you are willing to help me help her out and let her know that the world isn't always out to rain on her parade. she is located in massachusetts and i can provide proof if necessary (i'm kind of new to how r/r_a_o_p works so forgive me if i'm doing this wrong)

[] davis, ca - we are hungry, broke and unemployed and don't have many options. . my partner and i just moved to this town recently after living out of our car for a while and are really struggling to get by. we put everything we had into getting an apartment so we wouldn't be homeless anymore. i haven't been able to find a job since moving, and my partner just finally found a job this week and won't get his paycheck for another two weeks. rent is due tomorrow so we have nothing left for food. we have applied for assistance from other programs but haven't received anything as of yet. (also normally my boyfriend recieves the gi bill, but we had to move so he couldn't be in school this semester.) 

anyways we have never asked for help before and honestly it's hard even writing this, but we are sitting here trying to scrounge together a meal and it's just not enough. we would love a helping hand until we can get back on our feet - then we'd be happy to pay it forward! also i'm new to this sub and read the side bar, but if i'm not doing anything correctly just let me know :)
[] seattle wa, want a pizza, broke for another week. i am an older college student that is broke for another week.  i do have food options in my fridge but it has been forever since i had a delivery pizza.

i am not picky about the chain or toppings (except anchovies, yuck).  i would love just a multi-topping pizza of any size or crust and possibly soda to go with.
[req] 2 men, 1 cat. my roommate and i have both just moved into a new apartment recently and are hurting financially post-holiday/move. we would love if someone could forward us a pizza- friday is payday and i will gladly return the favor. we also have a very hungry cat that won't get off my keyboard.

thanks! we're in austin, in case you wanted to creep.
[] it's just been a really long few weeks.. been battling substance abuse for sometime, having some of the usual ups and downs. can't manage to stay clean longer then a few months. considering heading back to rehab, which is really scary. boyfriend dumped me two weeks ago, he's dating a girl i thought was my friend, and they apparently have been in love for quite awhile now. 

working two jobs has got me drained...and i really don't want to cook tonight. 

thanks for reading. =]

i live in the southern us.
[] college student and could use a little help :). i have very little in the bank right now, only make enough to actually pay my rent, and have almost no food in my house. didn't get to spend much time with my family this year. i'm an out-of-state student so i didn't even actually get to go home and have been here job hunting. none of my roommates are in town so i've been by myself for a while. can anyone help a girl out? i would be infinitely grateful!

also, i'm not really sure how this works, have never requested anything before. if you would like me to pm you anything else i would be more than happy to. just don't want to put a lot of personal information for all to see. :/ thank you so much. this community is the greatest.

[] - girlfriend and i just finished moving. she is... after a long and last-minute move out of our apartment into a new apartment that we really can't afford (long story), we accidentally kicked a hole in the drywall while moving our last boxes. 

bit of panic later, the girlfriend is currently zipcar-ing to home depot to try to find parts before they close. i told her i would get food--but little does she know i only have $38 in my bank account until **next** monday. http://i.imgur.com/ceun6ht.png

[] hungry, poor, and would love a pizza (wa, usa). i'm a college student who's a bit tight on cash right now. any extra money i have is going towards my projects for my major, so i don't have much to eat and i'm craving a pizza.

fyi, there's no papa john's in my town - only domino's, pizza hut, and a couple local places - just to keep in mind if anyone is kind enough to make an offer.
[] kind of embarrassed here, but i'd rather not have ramen for dinner yet again.... this is a throwaway account, but i'll provide my regular account to anyone who asks for it over pm. it's just that i have a friend who's a redditor and i'd rather she not know of my predicament :)

basically i've been eating ramen and macaroni and cheese for the past week because i have 3 cents in the bank. the reason for *that* is that i forgot that my student loan payment hadn't already been taken out of my account and spent the money on some pillowcases, pillows, and sheets instead of on groceries like i should have.

anyway, i'm not going to starve by any means, but i've run out of macaroni and cheese (and milk) so all i have til thursday when i get paid is ramen. location is eastern ny state.
[] winston-salem, nc - cause... tuesday. hey all,

[] hungry college student in nc, just finished summer term with straight a's, but i have no money until next week.. i feel kind of guilty asking this, because i'm usually the person helping out others, not the one looking for help. i just finished my summer term last night and wanted to celebrate somehow, and pizza is the go-to food for college students, right? well, i wanted to order some domino's last night for a night of ps3 fun but quickly realized it wasn't financially feasible at the time. in fact, i can't even get 10 bucks worth of gas right now to leave my apartment.

if you want, i can get screen shots of my grades to verify. and i **will** pay it forward when i get paid next month (my only income is from the gi bill, as i am unemployed right now). i'll send you the link when i do and of course i will thank you on here, publicly.

[] friend going to marine corps embassy duty, will not see him for three years. we would love to celebrate with a pizza. . he's always looked out for me and i would like to return the favor. he came home as a surprise to us which is great, but i can't celebrate because my girlfriend, son, and myself are going to be moving to a new apartment next month so we're on a very tight budget. we live near pizza hut and domino's. any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

i would be more than willing to provide proof in any way possible.
[] gastonia, nc

[] three adults and a baby, can't get food stamps, grocery money running low. rent is due this thursday, and we're cutting it close.. i'm living with my ex boyfriend, as he works in a factory third shift and can't take care of the baby but wants to live with her. his brother lives with us because his mom is a dangerous person and has nowhere else to go. he got laid off five months ago, when our baby was born, and because his employer didn't do paperwork, we were only eligable for one month of food stamps. 

he went back to work not too long ago, and when our lease was up, we could barely afford a new apartment. i was also just diagnosed with depression, and my medicine is another thing we have to worry about. our situation is very overwhelming to me, and i don't know how we're going to get through this. 

i wouldn't do this if i knew we would be okay, we have doctors appointments that are coming up, medicine to buy, food, rent, bills, tons of other things that are stressing us out, and when i found this, i could breathe a sigh of relief. please help us have a night where we don't have to worry so much, and i can repay you in cute baby pictures. :)
[] having major surgery on monday, would kill for my last good meal this weekend to come from dominos!. so, i am having surgery monday to hopefully end years of a painful rare kidney disease. i am sitting at home today realizing that today is really the last day i could really enjoy a great meal but i am broke.... 

i keep thinking about a week or more worth of hospital food, ok the jello will rock, and i am jonesing now for a pizza! 

i will be more than willing to pay it forward once recovered!
[] broke college student. currently been living on about 30 dollars for the last week and a half in college, waiting to get my student loan. there's been a strike going on though so i couldn't try to schedule a pickup until this week, and today i learned they still think i'm on my probation from last term (which i corrected by achieving a high enough gpa and got off probation with the school, but not osap). 

anyway, it's going to be a while before i can even pick up that loan but even after all that it will take a little bit before it's deposited to me. a pizza would easily last me a few nights worth of dinner and certainly beat the rice krispies and peanut butter sandwiches i've had for every meal the last week.

once that loan comes through i'll be sure to pizza it forward if someone comes through for me :)

i'm located in oakville, ontario
[] roomate and i could use some uplifting pizza - we will pass it along in the future!. we're not going to make up a sob story. we are both are employed full time and going to college full time, and thought it would be fun to give this a try. we would be more than happy to pay-it-forward should this work!
[] cousins and myself are stuck at hospital with no food or money. little guys and i would love some pizza. we are visiting our uncle at the hospital (orange coast memorial medical center in fountain valley, california). my cousins are 7 and 12 and i am a 21 year old broke college student. we are starving and have been waiting for hours. would love some pizza. 
[] starving students stuck in 3+ hour constitutional law class  pizza [x-post /r/randomactsofpizza bc my classmate doesn't know his subs] . **boston, ma**

so. we have this fabulous constitutional law professor who had to reschedule a few of our classes for i'm not sure what reason... i think she was at a conference, or something.

anyhow, this means that today our class is, at minimum, 3 hr and 15 minutes long... but she usually runs over time. because the class is from 10.45 am until 2 pm (it's 11.45 as i post this), this means that we also will be missing all of the club-meeting opportunities for free lunch. 

pizza would greatly be appreciated as we listen to scalia arguments!!

[]boyfriend and i just moved to athens, ga. new jobs, but no money and we just shared our last ramen.. we're pretty freaking hungry. we get paid friday but until then we have nothing. i knit like a madwoman and i will gladly send a knit good of your choice in return for a delicious pizza.
[] we haven't received our food stamps yet, and my sister and i are starving.. ...okay, we aren't *literally* starving (we have a few things to hold us over), but the only thing we have thawed out is hamburger meat, and we're going to do hamburgers tonight. however, my sister and i would love something to hold us over until then!

my mom's out right now, so a pizza to share between the two of us would be swell. &lt;3 i'm willing to go pick it up too, so you save money on the delivery!

i really don't know how to market this, sorry.

**edit**: plus, pizza just sounds really good. we're from the bay area~

[] dunnellon, fl  paypal takes 3 days to transfer.  entirely out of food today.  trade pp for gift card and will offer gift card here when the rest transfers.. i have cash in paypal but none in my bank account.  it takes three days for it to hit, and a couple of pies would bridge that lapse.

i need someone to swap me a $40 domino's gift card for $40 in paypal cash and in return when the rest of my paypal hits my account i'll offer a gift card here to someone who needs it.

it'll cost you nothing to help and gets someone else a gift card. :)

this is my first reddit post, i found raop while going through search results looking for pizza places that take paypal (if only i lived in the uk i could do it directly).

to be clear i am happy to send the cash first if you're a regular here.  i very much understand this is out of the ordinary.
[] girl in north texas, lost my house in the central texas fires.. my house was completely destroyed in the wild fires. up in dallas staying with my friend who is currently unemployed if anyone could send a gift code it would be very much appreciated. i don't know when i can repay the favor to raop but i will at some point.
[] didn't get paid today. would appreciate a pizza. i am a student and i work at my school's it call center. pay day was supposed to be today - but everyone's time sheet was not submitted due to a clerical error. i only have .88 cents in my checking account and was really counting on getting paid today so i could go buy groceries. i have some staples in my pantry, but those really need to last for two weeks until next payday. i would really appreciate a pizza to make up for not getting paid today.
[] bozeman, montana graduate student will pay it forward next week.. i'm a graduate filmmaking student at montana state university in an mfa program. i'm currently working as an equipment technician on a series being produced for discovery channel. however, the company i actually work for is based out of the uk and getting my first paycheck has been quite a long time coming, as paperwork and such takes awhile to go back and forth. i'm currently down to $2.00 in my bank account.

i am expecting to get my first paycheck next week and will gladly re-visit this board to pay the pizza forward and buy one for someone else who needs it. 

thanks for listening. :)

[] hungry and jobless, with nothing left to sell. hey roop, i recently was "let go" from my job, after asking for a month and a half to be scheduled more than 6 hours every two weeks. i've been searching for a job for the duration of this slow, twisted screw-over, but have had no luck. i will receive *some* unemployment, but it will not come in for another two weeks, provided my last employer doesn't somehow convince the state to also screw me over. it's been an unusually rough patch in my life, and i'll spare you the details of everything else, but i'm 3,000 miles from my family and they're too broke with medical bills to help. 

would anyone be so kind as to order me a pizza and feed me for a few days?

much love,
preston

[] nj, usa a lot of things seem to go wrong in my life around my birthday. could really use a pizza. . to start things off, my birthday was march 7th. last year i spent my birthday with my exgirlfriend. she brought me to a beach, then to a bar in seaside for food. we fought all day. this year i spent my whole birthday working in a sheet metal factory from 7-6pm. one friend smoked me up, then the rest of the night i spent smoking up all of my other "friends." my best friend didn't hit me up till 3am the next morning. 
now that i'm done being a little girl, heres what really sucks. i got laid off at the factory two days later because my boss's twin daughters were hospitalized for something. last week my car exploded on the parkway while on my way to secure a new job at a dispatch company working on ambulances. water pump exploded, lighting my alternator on fire.  and now. my droid 2 was stolen from me at a party last saturday. not to mention the brand new itouch i got for my birthday fell out of my hands while fumbling with my keys the night i got it.

in return i will write you a personalized short story about any topic of your choosing. it can be funny, sad, sexy, anything you want... maybe a combination of all three? hmmm?

[] pizza for student, will pass on..... well like the title says, just basically looking for an angel, somebody to guide me, a big brother or just simply a break. i'm 18 going into my 2nd year of college and on the top ramen diet. i am broke, i got less a dollar in my bank account. books have taken the most of $ and i have been applying for jobs but it has not been easy. if you can find it in your heart to simply give someone a break. please it would be great. i promise to pass it on when i get my loans in.
[] just got offered the new job.  been a rough couple of months, would like to celebrate. so finally after months of working part time and interviewing i was offered my dream job.  i've come to reddit a lot the last few months looking for  advice and entertainment.  

i'm just about through my savings so the next few weeks until i get that first paycheck are going to be really really tough.  i'd love to celebrate with a pizza tonight instead of the standard issue ramen/spaghetti.  i can post a picture of something and most certainly will pay it forward once that first paycheck comes in.

thanks guys

[] dad's a redditor and i think a pizza from other redditors would make his day. . his business is not doing so hot (printing - just like from the show the office hah.) and he hasn't been too happy about it. i know i could go out and get him a pizza but a) i don't have any money b) he would go completely crazy if he knew it was from reddit.


thanks guys! this subreddit is amazing. i love you guys
() no funny business here!. alright guys, i don't have some major sob story, my life isn't that bad or anything, i'm just broke until next thursday when my university issues refund checks to students. my promise to you all, is that if i can get a pizza tonight, i will pay it forward to a lucky individual next week, when i get my loan money from school. otherwise, i'm making ramen tonight (again). here is a picture of me with my scooting goggles on, so you know how serious this is. we roll hard down in the southwest.

[] greenville, sc usa looking for a great christmas pizza. hey, my bank account is over-drawn by $127. all i've got in my fridge is a half gallon of milk that expired 3 days ago, 2 bottles of woodchuck that i think are probably older than i am, and a slice of munster cheese. if there's anybody out there that would be in such a giving mood as to donate a pizza so i can have a good meal tonight and tomorrow it would be much appreciated. merry christmas to all of you here on raop.
the sea ate my card. (-barter). today while on a 5-6 hour hike, we returned to the city and i came home realizing that my id's debits and all of that good stuff did not make it back with me and being in a new place this month the fridge and cupboards have nothing in them. accept for a pouch of taco seasoning which might be ok but... 

sadly being 10:43pm i cannot get my bank stuff figured out.
i do not want it for free i most defiantly want to barter here 
is a list of things i can provide.
-pay it forwards once cards renewed
-write you a personalized poem (hand written and shipped by request)
- anything graphic design or audio engineering related 
- a print of some of my art work (sent by request)
- or anything you can come up with that i'm able.

i have never done this before i'm curious to see the outcome

[] broke till wednesday. new city, no family or friends to call.. [edit:  fountain, colorado]

my wife and i live on my social security, and anyone out there on it knows the dates for benefits always suck because it never pays on the same date, always making things bad.  our families are several states away and they're broke too.  my grandmother sent us cookies a few days ago and that's what we've lived on other than some instant rice.  we even started googling whether we can eat the cat's food.  we usually only eat one meal a day and a pizza would get us so much closer.  

i have been pizza'd before in a contest and we gave that away months ago to someone who needed it a lot more than us.   thank you raop.

[] four university of texas at austin students needing pizza to warm their hands and feet.. these are the reasons we need pizza:

1. one of our roommates is lost in a storm and we would like her to have some melty, tomatoey, cheesy goodness when (if) she survives and makes it back to our dorm.
2. one roommate is banging her head on her desk and if we had a pizza it would be a good cushion so she wouldn't hurt her head.
3. our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them.
4. one roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. probably to keep from crying. we think pizza would help.
5. this same roommate just announced that she had to fart. we need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste.
6. lucy is lost.
7. we can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either).
8. i just needed to have one more reason so that our list would have an even number of reasons because odd numbers are gross.

peace and blessins'

[] knoxville tn broke &amp; haven't eaten since yesterday. a pizza would be food for days.. simply put, i'm a broke college kid who hasn't eaten since lunch yesterday...and when i say broke i am not exaggerating. i was paid today and had to use the entire check to pay my bills. i'd kill for a pizza, especially since someone walked by me with a fresh one earlier and the aroma has stained my nose. 

details: i'm not a freeloader--i currently work on campus and am in the process of finding another job. it's surprisingly more difficult than expected, as i don't have a car or the money for a bus pass, so i have to stay in walking distance. i just got home from a 12 hour day on campus so this pizza would be the best way to end the day. 

please be my pizza hero!

[] texas. feeling a bit sick because of the cold weather and pizza sounds great. . any size pizza will do, considering that i'm the only person home and i have no car or real amount of money at the moment. all meats are good, no veggies.

[] no money, lost my job, i can verify all this. pizza would really help me out. please, i'm begging you. . so i just lost my job after four weeks for 'not meeting sales targets.' i had hardly any training, and the boss fired me knowing full well i have a mortgage and kittens to look after. my car has a stop light showing (peugeot 207, fucking french shit.) and i have no money in my bank. i'm at my wits end. please, help me.

[] lost my best friend.. i'm in emotional need.

but today i lost my best friend. 

my friend since fourth grade was bullied out of school in 6th, and nobody talked to him. i felt bad for him, and i stuck with him. several years go by, and i'm still his only friend, so i convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends! so school starts, and he meets my friends, he doesn't really click with them, and decides to meet new people. a month go by, and he meets some really bad kids. stupid kids no one else likes. any way, i try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder. 

when i tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. the bell rings, we go to class. after class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. 

this puts me in a bad mood. i storm home. he texts "what's wrong?" i tell him "you, punching me." he then, goes on about how i'm over reacting, because i'm upset, he punched me, and i tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  he then argues, that "i should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!"

i then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. i tell him "screw off. we're not friends. i don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault." i haven't talk to him since. this was a few hours ago. so i'm just lost. he's one of the few people i had left. 

i'd just like a pizza to cheer me up. 
. help a family whose mother might have ovarian tumor. . hi, to whomever kind soul might be reading this, i am pleading for someone to help/bring a smile to my family. yesterday, my mother went to the doctor, and her doctor said she has a possible chance of having ovarian tumor. she does not want us to worry but we all know how scared she is. she is the caretaker of the family, and with money being short right now, i know she is stress about having surgery if she does have the ovarian tumor. i do not have any money since i am going to surprise my mother with the money for her to use whatever little money i have given her for the surgery. i am begging a kind soul to possibly donate an ecard for my family so we can have a family meal as well as to let her know that there are people out there who are supporting her. i know there is alot of fraud on this page, but my story is true. please help my family thank you.

[] [ohio, usa] wiped out by bills, repairing my car and driving back and forth to the doctors... been a cancer(glioblastoma) survivor for 3 years now and been trying to find myself a permanent stable job, been surviving but this month has been rough. high bills this month and a car accident have cost me a lot of money, plus the gas use from having like 4 appts with the doctor and oncology(both about 30 min away) have drained my acct to about 2 dollars. it'd be awesome to dig into a pizza tonight instead of try and find something resembling a meal in my fridge or resorting to eating a roommate's food since he's not in the best of situations either.

[] my gf and i are sitting at home, working on a guide to give out to all the stupid freshman and sophomores who are about to get raped by the local realty companies. . hello redditors!

like the title says, my girlfriend and i are writing a "how to lease your first apartment" guide for all the new freshman and sophomores who are going to start signing leases next week. see, around here the apartment companies build up this hype that all of the best apartments will be gone if you don't sign on oct 5th. this is such shit! we were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . by perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are "left" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per person for these shit holes. 

basically, we are writing a guide for these students so they wont get screwed. i know that you guys are namely good at giving out pizza (which would be greatly appreciated) but any good advice you have for leasing an apartment is appreciated as well!

[] a table top rpg group in chicago. i have friends who come over every sunday for our weekly table top. we always order food or cook a meal for the group. none of us are needy, but i see a potential to get them involved with raop. 

if pizza shows up at our game with no knowledge of the players, it would be "magical" and would make them all aware of the raop. more importantly, they would now be inclined to participate. 

so, yeah. no one is needy/broke etc, i just wanted to start of a chain of action from our table top adventurers. :)

- (really, really long read)i have had the worst luck for an entire month. i would love a pizza to watch with the steeler game tonight.. here is everything that i have been going through for the past month

i went back to the hospital because of suicadal and depression...(ive already been once, and this time got diagnosed with bipolar)

gave me a shit tons of medicatinos, (i find out later that were all outdated,  and all had adverse side effects with each other)
missed 3 imporant auditions (i am an actor, missed 1 theater audition and two major film auditions, batman and avengers)'

as soon as i get released from the hospital, i get a nagging throbbing pain in my side, turns out to be a kidney stone, start pissing blood that wont stop for three week

then drove up to cph (cleveland playhouse) for a callback for their first downtown show (really big deal in cleveland) while dealing with a kidney stone
on my way there from parents house, which is  a two hour drive
my car broke down
so every 20 miles i had to get out, fill it up with water in the heatwave
so i just got more dehydrated which is awful for kidney stones, and just made things incredibly difficult and uncomfortable.

get there to the audition all sweaty, delarious, and dehyrdated
fucked up that audition
drove home, same 20 mile bullshit
go home, get the worst pain of my entire life, the worst pain you can ever imagine. google kidney stone pain.

while i was in the hospital, i lost my job, (which later turns into cutting hours) because they don't think i am "reliable and stable", so due to this, i can't pay rent on a new place, and my lease is up august 1st, so i have to move back home. 
work decides to give me hours, but only 20hrs a week, and from my parents house, its over an hour and 15 min away. 
then my 2cd week back at work, i got attacked again by kidney stones

[] duluth,ga 26(m). thanks for taking the time to read. due to medical circumstances(i work graveyard shifts, have hard time sleeping during the day, dental visits), i haven't been able to work the past week. therefore, i wont be getting a paycheck this week. i had just enough to scrape by my bills, and put enough gas in my car to get me to work and back this week so i can have a paycheck(finally) on the 20th. im usually ahead of the game/curve, pay my stuff early, etc. its just been a rough month.

if anyone feels like being generous, i only have one condition-let me do something in return. you name it(within reason) as long as it is very frugal in nature. i can write you a letter/card, valentines day card if you're a lady redditor. i can make pictures of my kitty. something along those lines. again, thanks for reading.

, unexpected electricity bill. hello,

i asked an old roommate if he could help me out, and he pointed me to this site. i'm not sure how this works or really what i'm doing. basically, i was really stupid, and somehow left my refrigerator door open, and my electricity bill went from around $40 to an unexpected $100. i'm honestly not sure what i'm going to do about food in the upcoming week, since i'm out the grocery money i was expecting. i have about 15$ in my wallet, but until they 15th i won't have a paycheck to do anything else. please let me know if i have to do anything to prove this. i'm embarrassed that i have to beg. to be honest, my stomach hurts today from eating only bread that i froze to make it last longer.

best regards,

allen

thank you dundahmifflin, because of you i will have something tasty to eat for a couple days. i really appreciate it so much. it's so nice to see a community like this.

i'm completely out of cash and won't be paid until monday from work. i'm currently studying neuroscience and hope to help the world one day. would definitely appreciate some help from the world tonight.

[] just moved in to a new place in washington and spent our last dime on a hidden pet fee.. throwaway as my only other account is a gonewild one :p. anyhow my boyfriend i just moved into a new apartment in seattle, paid all the fees, deposit, first months rent and moving costs and even had some cash left over before our next paychecks to buy food and necessary stuffs. came to get our keys this morning,  all our stuff in cars and a moving truck to find out the landlord had expected us implicitly to pay a two hundred fifty dollar fee when she agreed that our cute black lab rescue, bowser, could live with us. she in no uncertain terms told is it was the deposit or no dog, we paid up. so now we are very hungry  and we could use a pizza- not bowser of course; he has lots of food. which will hopefully remain a last resort. 
[] - accidentally overdrafted helping a friend pay his electric bill. pizza would really hit the spot about now.. a friend asked me if i had some spare cash to help him cover his electric bill, as he recently lost his job. i checked my bank account and saw that i had the money to spare, so i paid his electric for him. little did i know that payments i had made to other bills hadn't hit my bank account yet (stupid on my part to not verify this) so now i'm a bit in the hole! i'd planned on buying lunch at the cafeteria here at work, but my card was declined. anyone out there willing to pizza me? i'll be able to pay it forward on friday (pay day)!
[] i'd like to surprise my brother with a pizza.. i'm a little short on cash this week, or i'd buy it myself.
{}recently lost home, hard to make a hot meal in a motel room! (south jersey).. me and my fiancee recently lost our home. we were paying rent but the landlord was not paying the mortgage. as a result we had no where to go. we ended up having to stay in a motel untill we can find a new place. after the room is paid for the week and the car is gassed up so my fiancee can go to work just to pay for this room, there is close to nothing left. i have found work recently, but do not start for another 3 weeks. we basically live off of what food will fit in a mini- fridge. with morale being low right now, i think a hot pizza would lift spirits. there is nothing more soothing then some hot comfort food! 
and in the next few weeks i plan to buy someone a pizza myself. ... pay it forward they say!
[] wa is broke with a bummed knee a pizza would be really epic right now. i am so absolutely broke right now me and my boyfriend have been living off of ramen for a few weeks. i have a torn acl and pretty much confined to the chair. a pizza would really brighten our day up (: 
[] . so if you check my history you'll see in the last three weeks my credit card was skimmed, my car window busted, stitches put in my back without insurance, etc. etc.

today i just got my electric bill. $320 dollars because my 17 year old thermostat decided it'd be cool to run the ac and heat at the same time. i work part time for a non-profit that doesn't pay much. with everything that's happened, i am tapped out and will be for a couple months. a pizza can probably last me three days of leftover goodness. 

i've been making the most of noodles, rice, and such from the food bank for the past week. i'm hungry and i hate scammers. i intend to pay it forward. i have no problems using the verification code/pming my address/sending you a printscreen of the adorable graph on my bill quadrupling/etc.

thank you friends.

{} bloomington, in co-operative living house scammed and in need of food. (explanation in comments. so let me just start off with an introduction. i live in a house with 13 people. we all pay for everything together. including food, it's basically part of our rent. we also have 4 other houses that are run this way and we all work together. well we went to place our monthly bulk food order this week. we go through this guy who used to lie here because he does it for a few places and get a discount this way. well anyway this week we get a notification that our bulk order didn't go through because the company didn't get our money. so we call this guy and he swears he paid them and its a company error. so of course we called back the company and they did a thourough search and found nothing. now the man is not answering us or anyone. so we have no food money for this month and no food. it's my turn to cook dinner tonight and i dont know what to do. can anyone help us out? thanks in advance

it would be really awesome if someone could order my husband and i a pizza. we have no children or anything like that. just broke until tomorrow. we usually plan our money well, but our car broke down 2 times in the past 3 days. first our fuel pump went out, we got that fixed now the battery went out (possibly the alternator which i hope not) . we just bought this car so it cut us short all around.. we don't have enough money to even get the /battery/ fixed until tomorrow as well. anyways that's the reason why we are broke at the moment. we usually keep our refrigerator full but that didn't happen this week. 

also..some kind redditor helped us out awhile ago with pizza. i have 10$ in my amazon account i can order something for you in return.. we're just really hungry..

sorry if this is kinda all over the place i have not slept in almost two days. 

if you need any proof just ask, nothing to hide here.

[] ok, so i'm not exactly asking for free pizza. but i have a proposition.. yesterday, i helped a fellow redditor out by finding a video he's been searching for in return for some pizza. [link to thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/19u7rr/i_will_order_you_pizza_for_the_right_song/)  

however, since he's in another country, his credit card couldn't go through, and he was unable to place an order online. so he sent me $24 through paypal. :)

i've been in a sort of a rough patch, and haven't had a decent meal in weeks. so i was really looking forward to having pizza for dinner on a saturday night. unfortunately, i found out papa john's and pizza hut don't accept paypal. 

now i'm not sure if i'd be breaking any rules by doing this. if i am, please let me know and i'll take this down. if not, then i would be more than happy to send someone $24 through paypal if they could order some pizza for me.

nothing terribly special... uk dweller (south east coast represent) who lost my job last august, ekeing out a living for the last 6 months or so on my severance pay but nothing has come up yet.

i've held out for as long as i can without making a claim for any benefits (which i've just started on) and have been living super frugal for the last month or so. 39p pasta sauce and a can of tuna only gets you so far before you want to throw in the towel. come monday i can stock up on some more varied food stuffs again (and pick up those skyrim ps3 dlcs that have been rubbing my nose in my shitty financials) but right now, i'm hankering for some comfort food.

if someone can help me out, i'll be paying this forward at a later, more  financially stable, time.

peace out, fellow dovah. your love is appreciated.

[] moving military redditor around mcminnville, or. hello folks, figure i'd give this a shot considering my current circumstances.  now i know i'm not as bad off as a lot of the folks around here but i figure what little help i could get will be appreciated.

without going into to much detail of my life i'll keep this short.  before i head overseas i decided to move my family back to where our family is.  the home buying and moving (on my dime) process has dragged on longer than expected and that has cost us more money than budgeted because of the delay.. i have enough money to put fuel back in the tank and right now we are eating basically what we packed out of our pantry.  we have to last little less than a week and we'll be good.

i have a couple of older boys with me and i'm sure they'd also appreciate some pizza about now...  thanks in advance and it feels good be get back home to oregon....

[] benefit concert. one of my classmates (graduate of a high school in 2011) had a terrible motorcycle accident. he was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. he is still in critical condition and i am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. they lost their mother when they were young (elementary school) and ethan (the boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. i've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly. 

i'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing.
if i get enough, i'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family! 

here is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular

the pizza place (shaker's) does not deliver so i will have to pick it up. you can order it for september the 28th from 1pm-6pm. you can possibly even preorder it! but if you do decide to order, order it under the name of "steeple". that's how i'll pick it up. thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! it means a lot. i've been so busy with this concert. 

the pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.

edit: also, please let me know if you order and for what time.

[] tucson, arizona; $6 to my name that has to pay for gas to get to work all week. . i've ended up sticking myself in a bit of a rut, guys. i've been living on my own for about 6 months now, and about 3 months ago, finally found a job. it's great and all, but the hours are less than desirable. corporate won't let us go over 32 hours a week. i get paid every two weeks. this last pay period has hit me pretty hard in the wallet department. i finally had the money saved up to put down on a vehicle. a motorcycle, actually. considering how cheap they are overall, i think it was a pretty good choice. unfortunately, paying my bills, $100 out of the paycheck for the motorcycle payment, and another $100 or so to get it road legal...has left me without food until friday. the change that i've collected over the past couple months adds up to $6.17, which i need to use to fill my gas tank so i can get to work.  i'll be straight up here, a large pizza could feed me for 2 days, 3 if i stretch it. i would certainly be willing to pay it forward to another unfortunate soul in the coming weeks, if someone were to help me out now.
[] young parents in austin.. . new in town and waiting for that first pay check (15th)
living off change/2$ p. terrys burgers til then..

[] ontario canada - ethnic minority student studying for 2 exams (both tomorrow).. about to die. hi! i just found this amazing place, and thought i'd give a nice funny title to my post (although i am an ethnic minority).

[] at 12 am est it will be my birthday. at 12 am est it will be my bday and after a rough year all my gf and i would like is a pizza delivered. anything goes on the pizza but we are normally vegetarians. 
() it hasn't been a good week.. i've never done this before and i'm not sure what to expect but this has been one hell of a week.  
i and my boyfriend are on a weird pay week, which means we won't be paid til next monday.  
all our bills are paid, so we're fine there. however, he (the boy) has been working overtime like crazy and yesterday he had a blowout of his back tire and we had to get all four of his tires replaced.  
if someone is feeling generous, i would love to feel the love.  
thanks guys and even if no one answers my call, i've noticed how many pizzas have been gifted to people who really need it and you guys are awesome! keep being amazing and thanks!
oh! before i forget, i'm in pasadena, ca. i know location is important!

[] screwy finances left me penny-less. 24, san francisco. i've been working at my new job for a few months, and it's been up and down for some time. this last paycheck, i had to buy a bunch of furniture for my new apartment, and had scheduled my bills and payments particularly close together, knowing i'd be cutting it close to my next paycheck.

come tuesday, my debit card was declined for a payment that i knew was coming. i went to check my account and it turns out my gym membership had not been paid, draining my bank account to about 20 dollars.  adding insult to injury i got sick on thursday, and half of my stuff is at my new apartment.

so here i am sitting alone in a half empty apartment with  no money, sick, broke, and waiting till the 30th to get back on my feet. any help between now and then would be awesome, and i promise to pay back the roap by matching the help given to me.

pm me for details, i have my verification number ready.
[] new york, usa -- i just really love pizza!. hello!

i haven't had pizza in the longest time and i have this *huge* craving for it. if there is someone who is in dire need of food please skip me and go to them! but if not, i'd love to celebrate the end of a day with some awesome sauce pizza. 
[] my daughter's ing pizza, my hands are tied!. my daughter just recently started kindergarten, and after lots of worrying she seems to be doing really well. (she's a trooper!) i promised her a special dinner this week and she'd specifically requested pizza, but i had some unexpected bills and now pizza isn't really an option.

it would really make her week and mine if someone would throw us a pie (and possibly some breadsticks--she loves dipping!)

thanks for reading!

[] been to off work sick since july 9th. not being paid sick leave.. they are being fussy about it, won't get sorted till august 12th at least.

i would normally be paid on a week to week basis but well not at the momment...

requesting thursday nights dinner.
[] chicago. humble  by a failing family provider.. hi guys. husband with lovely (and of course very nice) canadian wife here. lost my job recently and having trouble making ends meet with all of our funds tied up in lawyer and federal fees for my wife's us citizenship. while i've been blessed with a loving wife and our loyal and hilarious pups, i cannot afford to provide them with anything special during this rough time - even after a humble holiday and stringent budgeting for groceries and supplies from the likes of aldi and dollar general. 

truthfully, i'm ashamed to admit that i've failed so completely in being a good provider for my tiny family and i'm glad we decided to wait on having kids so they don't have to struggle with us. but i also have no illusions about this and i'm well-aware that the responsibility lies squarely in my hands. that said, i know how effective something as simple as a pizza would be in raising the spirits around here so i'm sucking it up and asking for help from a community i've valued for quite some time now.

my wife is vegetarian, so i would request a cheese pizza. my local dominos is the cheapest i know of and has a coupon for an extra large 1-topping for $9.99 ($13.26 w/tax), which is actually better than the regular price of a large ($14.37 w/tax). there are various other coupons as well, from dominos store #2878.

bonus: my wife would be more than happy to draw the subject of your choice in mspaint!

**tl;dr**: currently failing at providing for family, humble request for a bit of cheesy sunshine through the clouds, mspaint bounty offered.

no matter what happens or doesn't happen as a result of this request, i just want to express sincere thanks to everyone in this subreddit. the fact that this even exists is yet another testament to all of the good in this world and i can't wait to pay it forward!
[] very hungry student needs something to eat while studying. it's been a busy busy term and i haven't been able to find a part-time job so the groceries have stretching since september and i just can't afford to get out to the grocery store right now. my cupboards hold nothing but an almost empty bag of pasta and my fridge just a can of tomato sauce. i need to do a lot of work this week, but i just can't concentrate due to weakness. help me please and i promise to pay it forward. 

edit: i live in victoria, bc. 
[] sad girls seek pizza asap!. sad girls seek pizza in southeast masachusetts!

my best friend is letting me stay at her house for a couple days due to a mild case of homelessness, and we have a lot of feelings. we want to watch mean girls and bond because she misses her boyfriend (a doctor stationed in ok), and we're really hungry, too! she has a dollar to her name, and my boss from my summer job owes me $1,500 - of which i've received nothing.

a little boost in the form of domino's would be so appreciated and i'll be sure to pass on the favor as soon as i can!

edit: i'm not a woman (well, girl?) of many talents, but if you want, i'll sing for you or draw a picture or write you a story. i can't promise they will be awesome, but i will try! anything for my friend's happiness/ pizza. :)

love,

[] a pizza. (not a sob story, just the truth). hey redditros, 

just asking for a pizza for me and my kids. single father, times are rough, and a pizza would surely help us bring our spirits up. 


()single mom of 3 looking for help with food.. hi my name is amber brown i am the single mom to 3 children and i just lost my job a couple of weeks ago. i have been trying to find one with no luck yet, and i am in need of help getting food for the four of us. i was hoping there would be someone out there who could help me i would appreciate very very much.
. i'm a disabled single mom &amp; my only son's birthday is this week.  our house was vandalized last week &amp; w/ the power on, theives took all the wiring while we were away!  neighbors called the police &amp; the thieves also took all of our appliances!  anyway, my son's favorite thing to eat is pizzia!  they stole all his electronics &amp; games etc. &amp; i hope this will cheer him up!  god bless one &amp; all who donate to this awesome site! we are w/ friends in central fl now.
 [] daytona beach, fl
(will buy the kind donor a pizza tomorrow or monday). starving, upset with usps for slacking on check delivery, car-less and it's raining (not meatballs). will buy whoever gets me a pizza next week. 
[] worked a long day on duty weekend, would love a pie to ease the pain :d. just feeling some pizza, if you can, awesome.. if not well-- i appreciate the kindness of all others anyways!
[] tampa, fl hungry and dough-less. hey, i figure this is a long shot, never tried anything like this before. here goes, i am a student at hcc, because of student loans, i have literally no money for food. haven't had a hot meal in 4 days. my food stamps come in next week, but until then, i was hoping for a little something to nibble on.
[] looking to get a pizza for a buddy of mine. i'd buy it myself, but he lives in washington and i live in texas, and i don't have a debit card. since the technology to email a pizza hasn't been invented yet, i'll thank anyone who orders him one by drawing them something in return :d
[] working my way through a case of ramen. hello raop,

figured i'd give posting here a shot. i've been out of work for about six months now, applied literally everywhere in walking and bus distance. i still live at home, and on top of stretched funds, my mother's card recently got overcharged and left us with $15 for two weeks. she gets paid in a few days but i think instead of coming home and going straight to bed, a pizza might really lift both of our spirits. 
[] i'll gladly pizza you tuesday, for a pizza today?. hey guys,
i've been broke as a joke the last couple weeks. raided the pantry completely and have made plenty of "canned food and rice" surprises. last of the monies went in the gas tank and i'm now down to the last cup of applesauce and could use a solid meal and leftovers for the next couple days. i have payment coming this tuesday/wednesday and will gladly return the favor to my offerer! 
thanks!
[] stuck at work from 7pm yesterday until 10am tomorrow, no food in the fridge, no money in the pockets.. so, i'm stuck at work (a lan center in grand rapids, mi) since 7pm yesterday because of a lack of relief shift, and i have to work until 10am tomorrow*. i haven't had a chance to go home and pick up more food, and there's nothing in the work fridge, and i'm broke until payday next week. i ate the last of my lunch recently, so i won't need anything until later (11pm-12am or so, though i'm happy to stick it in the fridge if nothing's open that late). i'm more than happy to pay back a specific person next week on payday, or to just spread the love around to others when i can.

(* i volunteer, and spending this long down here doesn't bother me; i really do love helping out here. we lack employees that actually care, so i'm happy to take up the slack. i just lack the food to keep me going, is all.)
&lt;&gt; hungry jobless bum looking for a kind heart to hold me over with a hot meal.. i'm not one for charity, and i don't like to ask things of people. i'm sure that gets said a lot, and words are meaningless, but at some point hunger just has to override pride. i don't know if it's too late for this even to matter, but it's worth a try.
() parents recently went through a divorce and don't have much money, a pizza would be nice :]. hi i'm ian.

i live with my mom and three siblings in la. my parents recently got in a divorce and between all the legal fees, there's not a steady flow of money coming in. it would mean the world to me if i could help my mom out and surprise her with a pizza/dinner. i know she'd be happy. if anyone could help we would really appreciate it. 
() had the worst weekend; still reeling.. first off, long time lurker, just found out about this subreddit and thought maybe someone may be able to help. over the weekend, i let a good friend of mine borrow my 1998 ranger. he ended up drinking and driving and drove through a fence (and then on my rims around the block). totaled it. it was the last thing my dad gave me and i can't afford repairs nor the tow for weeks. by the time i can get it out, it will be costing more than it's worth. i am still going to get it out and fix it, because it is sentimental. all i have to eat is rice for the next three weeks (maybe more); so, i'm not starving, but a pizza would really be a pick-me-up at this point.

[] pizza for my anniversary?. i couldnt afford to take the gf out for our 9 yr anniversary.. been applying to jobs round the clock but nobody is hiring out here. i'd really appreciate it if somebody could throw me a giftcard or something, otherwise it's ramen again for dinner. (and we're running low on that, too)

either way, thanks to y'all for being so awesome and helping out others. this subreddit warms my heart.

[] disabled college student, just plain hungry. hey there fine folks of raop! i'm a sophomore here at texas state university. this year has been particularly tough on me financially, but i've managed to stay afloat until now. i have a disease called hidradenitis suppurativa. i would not suggest google searching, unless you'd like to lose your appetite. i've been living with the disease for six years and it's been incredibly difficult. i get large cysts, sometimes the size of baseballs.. in my underarms, between my breasts and in my groin area. this makes it so hard to move any of my extremities, really. my insurance recently stopped paying for my medications, so i'm having to spend $2,200 a month to keep myself able to function properly. i have tried so hard to keep myself above water, but it's impossible with all of the medical bills from radiation therapy (not covered by insurance) and medication expense. i'd really love to have something, anything for dinner. of course, when i'm able, i will pay it forward.

edit: i can offer to purchase you something from amazon in exchange for pizza.. i'm broke cash wise, but i do have a bit of money on my amazon account.
[] denver, co, usa. broke, and hungry. . moved up here hoping to get a better job, didn't work out like that. have a job, but it's enough to pay the bills, and that's really it. payed rent, got cat food for the kitty, and tp. pretty much emptied the bank account. still looking for a better job, but until then, a hot cheesy pie would really make my day!
[] in the middle of nowhere with my sisters kids. can't afford to buy them pizza.. im a 15 y/o babysitting my sisters kids and i can make them some noodles but i was clumsy and dropped the sauce on the floor so they would have to eat them plain which sucks. the only place to get pizza nearby is dominos but its not within walking distance so i cant get them anything since i dont have enough cash to pay for delivery and a tip. if anyone could help us out we'd consider ourselves blessed. thanks.

[]fort campbell, ky broke, hungry and dining facilities are closed. hello everyone, my buddy wanted to help me out so he told me about this fantastic place (hence this account being made today). i am a single soldier stationed at fort campbell. today i've noticed instead of withdrawing the normal $150 for my car payment my bank has taken out $600 dollars leaving me -$527 in my bank account. they said they'll fix it but not till they open again on monday. normally this would be alright because i have a meal card except this weekend my on post dining facilities have closed for the easter weekend. i haven't eaten since breakfast on friday and could really use some food. anything would do. i don't have a car or i'd try and forage around. this is literally my last option at this point.  if you want proof of the bank account i can send you a picture, if you can tell me how to take a screen cap of my phone (my only internet access).

again thank you, and if you don't trust a new account i fully understand i'm just desperate.

[] north dakota usa. low on funds and blood sugar.. i just got out of the hospital a few days ago and immediately spent all of my money on a variety of new prescriptions that i needed to start. i'm out of food now and don't get paid until tomorrow. i'm type one diabetic so i'm kind of afraid that if i don't eat anything at all today i'm going to be in rough shape tomorrow. that, and after over a week of hospital food and dry cereal pizza sounds amazing. so if someone would be generous enough to provide me with one, i would appreciate it greatly.

(phone number is 870-743-3500) i can pickup from there no problem. i will recieve va education benefits on the 6th and can pay it forward on that day. from the bottom of my heart and from the pit of my childrens stomachs (not having to suffer through my sad attempt at cooking a meal) thanks to anyone who can help us!
[] long story short.... i'm hungry.

atlanta, ga
[]just moved from overseas and i'm hungry! (southern ga). the title pretty much sums it up. 

i've recently moved back to the states from italy. all my household items are on a large ship on their way over which means i don't have much to use for cooking in way of utensils. 

i'm not scrimping for pennies but i am being frugal till i figure out my means here (especially since i'm on the hunt for a job) so if the pizza fairy is waiting for someone truly in need then wait for another post! 


[] hey guys, i'm kinda down on my luck... no job, lost the girl, broke.. i'd really appreciate a pizza right now! :). yeah as the title says i'm in a pretty bad spot and on top of these things i'm hungry! i'll be sure to pay it forward once i'm in a better situation!!

rae here.
longtime lurker, first time poster.
i moved to new york state about a month ago, and have been on the job hunt since like, day one. now, i've finally managed to get myself a job, but it doesn't start until next thursday, and i've got just enough money left in my account for laundry and my phone bill, so until then i'm bumming off of my roommates for food, which i have been for the last two weeks.

there are a whole mess of really great pizza places within walking distance of my apartment, and i'd really like to get a pie to share with my roommates, as thanks for putting me up for so long.
**[]** spent all of our money on our hungry cats, please feed us too!. we are three hungry girls in brooklyn, jealous of our cats enjoying friskies grilled mix that we spent our last collective $8.49 on. we don't get paid until tomorrow evening! we saw this on a new report a while ago, so we aren't exactly sure how to use it, but it sounds like all you have to do is return the favor! we can do it tomorrow! can any kind soul help out there?? attached below is my bank account to prove it! it's been a rough week!

thanks so much and we love you!

[] i am trying to get my grades back up by the end of the week and then i have midterms next week....also, my cat died....... i have this week alone to make up all the work i have missed. i have just lost one of my cats to liver disease and i miss him alot. he was only 2 years old. midterms are next week and i have to study along with getting my work in. a redditor giving me a pizza will make my week and make me work even harder. i will also take requests for things to do in return. thank you! (i live in ypsilanti, michigan)
[] for my kids, in castle rock, co. . i'm in the middle of a divorce. i'm picking my kids up tonight after work for their week with me. i only get paid once a month and pizza is off the menu because of that. i've got ramen and frozen hotdogs and such for the rest of the week, but i'd love for my boys to have something exciting on their first night with me. 
thanks raop!
[] could use some game of thrones fuel!. me and one of my college friends have been living on little to nothing this past weekend till i can get my next paycheck (i work at a writing help center).  would anyone like to make tonight's game of thrones episode watching 10x better?  the nearest joint is a pizza hut in fulton, ms.
[ or exchange] in between jobs and subsequently paychecks. envato marketplace exchange.. so i just moved out to denver for a job that i then lost (was hard working with some of the other employees, and the company was going in a bad design direction).  i was lucky enough to get another job within a week but i'm now between paychecks.

i have $100 on the envato market place i can exchange for pizza.  i'll double the cost of the pizza in return.

    if you don't know about envato, they run these amazing sites:
    http://themeforest.net/ - really nice website and wordpress themes.
    http://codecanyon.net/  - php scripts/classes and wordpress plugins, jquery and javascript stuff.
    http://audiojungle.net/ - music and sound fx for movie or game production.  
    http://videohive.net/   - after effects projects scenes and other video assets.
    among others you can navigate to from any of their sites. 

i make money selling items on codecanyon but they pay out on the 15th once a month.

i'll purchase any item or items you want up to around $60 ( so around $30 in pizza ), how much is up to you.


i would much rather have pizza than hamburger helper without any hamberger (hamberger is expensive you know).
[]  denver student getting back on my feet after being away at school.  also currently babysitting 2 nieces w/o pay. *
[ uk] hungry couple need cheering up. if anyone could help me and my girlfriend out it would be amazing and we would pay it forward when we get back on our feet.
both unemployed at the moment in a new city. we have managed to cover rent and bills for the month, but at the expense of nice food and quality of life.
any type of nice food would go a long way if anyone can help us out and will repay the favour to other worthy redditors asap.
; any pizza of any kind! california bay area. my friends and i are working on our high school senior gift, an enormous mural. (even though we have already graduated). i recruited a bunch of non- artistic friends, because my original "art" partner totally bailed on me with the entire thing. we would love a pizza! pm if you are feeling generous! (no pressure!) we are willing to carry out!
[] about to get off work pizza for dinner would be nice. im in a hard spot used up all of my last paycheck on bills and have less than two [dollars] (http://imgur.com/np2kmrs) for these next 5 days had to use the last of my money for gas. pizza from anywhere would be appreciated thank you &gt;.&lt;
[] i let my kids down. can i be a cool mom and treat them to pizza? atlanta, ga. my kids are home for the summer, and i have nothing good to cook tonight. payday is a few days away and (despite my epic culinary skills) i can't muster up anything tasty. last night i tried to make a spicy noodle dish with broccoli that caused the kids not speak to me for the rest of the evening. please help me reclaim my position as a cool mom. the kids have different tastes, but a nice pepperoni pizza would do the trick. thank you for considering me and the little ones. 
[] 23 year old in need of help. hello reddit. i am very afraid of you. o ao

i am a 23 year old from marietta, ga. i lost my job on my birthday back in may and haven't been able to find anything since. i've been doing art commissions since then to try and boost my morale and keep my chin up, but they've slowed a bit and i just paid a student loan payment. with next to nothing in my fridge, $34 in my bank account and a phone bill coming up, i'm broke and hungry.

i'm also really scared of rejection! o ao 

also, if you're interested in anime-style art commissions or anything of the like, please let me know and i'll get you a link to my deviantart page. after all, that will help me out just as much as a pizza!

thank you for looking!
 - hungry, me and my roommate havent eaten all day. okay, so me and my roommate are in a sticky situation. we both don't get paid until thursday, and we haven't eaten all day. we also don't have much food left in the house, just chips and snacky stuff. my mom cant help me with money until tomorrow night and her parents don't even live close to us. a egift card for pizza would work wonders right now.

- i posted this already just a few minutes ago but i cant see it for some reason, so im posting it again to see if it works

[] pizza for two?. hi, i've gotten laid off a little bit ago, and tired of not getting any calls or interviews. i don't like giving sob stories and i feel a little embarrassed even asking for food, but would really enjoy a pizza if someone can maybe help me out. if you need any proof, i'd be glad to provide some. 
- very sick asu student. i waited for four and a half hours at the er two days ago for a friend with alcohol poisoning to wake up. said friend was ungrateful that i brought here there and has thusly ditched me. that being said, the er gave me some weird chest funk and i can't talk and can barely breathe since i'm coughing so frequently. i also happen to be starving and can't leave my dorm building to get food. i'll pay it forward as soon as i have a voice to order a pizza with.

[] here in california, a non-redditor friend believes that raop is complete bs. can we prove him wrong?. my friend thinks that raop is a farce, and either an attempt to gather addresses or send pranks. i just want to show him he's wrong. a large extra cheese/extra sauce pizza might change his tune. afterwards, i might be able to convince him to pitch in to fulfill someone else's request...

i'm located in the antelope valley in california. i intend to provide pictures of said delicious pizza if it arrives.
[] having a bad luck streak. (des moines, ia). my 20th birthday was the 14th (of may) and i was kicked out of my place (i had just been laid off). since then i have moved in with a family member, but we are out of food (he is on food stamps, i am in the process of getting them and getting unemployment while i find a new job). today his car broke down so we are having trouble trying to hit up the local food pantry, we have some food in the house but i would love to surprise him with a pizza pie for dinner tonight.

willing to provide any proof needed. will be able to return the favor at the end of june (should have my unemployment by then)
[] college student wanting to surprise her boyfriend with pizza!. hi guys-- i'm a college student in atlanta, georgia. i just finished my finals and today is my boyfriend's last day at his awesome co-op. i'd love to be able to make today a celebration! regrettably, like more students, i'm flat broke. anyone willing to help my boyfriend and i celebrate? as soon as my loan money comes in in january i'd love to return the favor :)
[] essex junction, vt - nearly broke, need to use what i have left to visit dying grandmother in montreal. pizza would be lovely tonight :(. hi, i've never requested this before and i feel a bit ashamed in having to do so, but it would make the world of a difference. i have a good, stable job and always have. i've always been responsible with money and have nearly no debt, except for one credit card which i'm about halfway done paying. this last week has wrecked me financially. my car is a piece of shit and i spent $766 on brake stuff (pads, rotors - i can show proof of this) and now i'm nearly broke. 

i have about $70 in my account (i can also show proof of this) and i need it to fill my gas tank (which costs about $40 here in vermont). my dad called me this morning to tell me that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital last night and she has pancreatic cancer. there's nothing they can do. they can't operate. my dad is not doing well. i'm here in vermont and my family is in montreal. i'd like to go to montreal tomorrow to see my grandmother and be with everyone during this time. 

my fridge has hardly anything in it (i can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. it's been a rough monday so far. a pizza would mean that i'd have a meal for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow, and dinner on the way to montreal tomorrow. i can also provide a verification code. i only get paid again on thursday and so i'm looking to see if anyone will help a girl out. many thanks.

[] no manipulative sob story, id just like a pizza for me and my wife for lunch.. we dont tend to have fast food pizza, we make all our own food at home, but we do enjoy a good hot pizza every now and then. we are incredibly unlikely to buy ourselves a pizza, as we tend to use our food money at the farmer's market, but if someone were to buy us a pizza today, i would definitely return the favor, or pay it forward, whichever the sender prefers. we are located in north florida and we are not at all picky as to which chain the pizza comes from :)
[] haven't eaten since lunch yesterday in mission viejo, ca. pizza would be the best thing ever for my four friends and i.. we ate lunch yesterday around noon, then proceeded to get crazy hammered and have zero food (literally. i checked) in the house. we're also out of money on account of paying for gas to drive some girls home this morning. fact is, we're starving. i remembered hearing about this place awhile back and thinking, "displacedleprechaun, one day you'll be hungry as hell. try that subreddit and see if it can help."

so here i am. and if it works, come this friday on my payday i'll be giving a pizza to someone on here. fair is fair.

cheers!
() having an absolutely horrible week and no food.... i've been having such a down week worrying about my sick mother, being overloaded at work, how we'll be paying rent and upcoming bills, let alone food, for the next week...i would absolutely love some warm food to help tidy my growling stomach and my mind in the meantime.  our pantry is bare and i have little $ to my name at the moment.

i'm located in california by the way  

i can pm you from my main account, i was just paranoid/ashamed because a simple google search provided much detailed information about me; i use that username all over the web..

thank you, reddit~
[] need help for friend of mine. so, a friend got screwed out of a place tonight (landord dick-ness), and as such is stuck using what little money she has left paying for a hotel in southwest florida. if you kind pizza-ers can give her a hand that'd be swell. i know it's not me, but she's never used reddit, and college has also left me quite poor. you have my word that i will pay it forward. thanks regardless!
[] hungry student in michigan. i just arrived back at school after visting my family in wisconsin over the holidays. unfortunately while i was there i ran in to some pretty serious car problems and a hefty bill. paying for my car so i could make it back to school cost everything in my bank account (and a couple hundred dollars my parents were able to help me with ): ). now i'm at my appartment with nothing to eat and could really use a pie to tide me over untill class starts monday and i get my financial aide. thanks 
[] u of illinois student- no room in the budget for pizza, but really want a pizza.. hey all, i'm paying for my own college and trying to keep costs as low as possible. therefore, there is no room in my budget for pizza, but i am seriously jonesing a pepperoni pizza right now. if you can help me out, pm me and we'll get something sorted out. thanks for looking!
[] st. louis usa - needing to feed my children but broke and sick. my husband just started a new job but until we get his first paycheck we are completely broke.  he is at work and i have the flu and can't get up off the couch and my three children are bugging me about what is for dinner.  would anyone be kind enough to provide a pizza for us? 
[] tallahasse, fl - it's been a rough month and i'm sick of ramen.... as the title says, it's been a rough month for my family for a number of reasons financial troubles being on the top of the list. my reason for posting is that groceries have been pretty sparce for the past week or so. the kids, wife and i have been had our fill of bland pastas and such. payday is in less than a week and the generosity of friends and family in addition to picking up odd jobs here and there are the only things that have gotten us through this month.

long story short, a pizza sounds unbelievably awesome right about now, even more so when imagine the how excited the kids would be after a week of serving dinner to sad face and disappointed grumbles.
[] hungry and broke college student. just got done paying this months bill, rent, and utilities. won't have any cash coming in for a little more than a week. a pizza would definitely keep me alive for a good part of that. would happily provide college proof if necessary
[] just rode my bike home from work in the the rain and the power is off in my house (can't use microwave) and a warm meal would be nice. buffalo, ny. 
[] finally made the decision to leave abusive relationship, starting with staying alone this weekend with an empty fridge. usa. so, in light of the article that has been floating around here, i feel kind of timid about putting this out there, but i guess i have nothing to lose at this point. in the past, he has searched my reddit history and scolded me for things i posted, etc., but i know that a throwaway won't be acknowledged, so i guess i'll take my chances on him getting mad about this.

i've been in an emotionally abusive relationship for quite some time, and it has been absolutely wrecking my sense of self/sanity.   this weekend, we were supposed to go to his family's cabin, and over the course of the week there were many , "well, i'm going alone!" and "i want you to come with, baby" moments.  that is probably the tamest and most concise way to tell the story.  last night, he was shining a flashlight repeatedly, directly in my eyes, to try and make me go to bed with him, if that gives any insight.

i am proud of myself for deciding not to go with him this weekend, even if we were on a "high" this afternoon. 

i am moving out the first of august, and am trying desperately to save money for my security deposit/first month's rent. to be honest, i was looking forward to free meals with his family, but i decided it wasn't worth it.

the icing on the cake is that i'm one of those people who doesn't eat when they're stressed out, so right now it's just me, a box of wine, and whatever i ate yesterday hanging out in the house.  logic tells me i should eat.   anyone?

i would absolutely love to pay it forward when i have my feet on the ground.

[]broke after getting screwed over by laptop support. can't stand eating ramen anymore.. i'm home from college for the summer and my parents are gone for the weekend. unfortunately, my lcd screen failed on my toshiba laptop and after shipping it to them, they've told me that i owe them $200 for fixing the power jack before they'll fix my screen despite the fact that it's under warranty and that i didn't send it in for them to fix anything but the screen. after arguing with them over a span of two days and looking at other options, i gave in and am now broke. i've eaten ramen for virtually every meal for the past 2 and a half days and i can't do it anymore. it would be sweet if a fellow redditor could help a guy out.
[] passed up free tickets to the packers game so i could watch the game with dad instead.. now all i want is pizza hut. :)
[] jacksonville, florida usa i would love to eat a delicious pizza to take my mind off school.. i am feeling depressed. i do not know if it is the study of law and the tedious reading that goes with it or the hunger in my belly causing it. if some kind soul wishes to help me eliminate the hunger in my belly, we can narrow the source. i would eternally grateful to any kind soul wishing to assist me in these trying times.
[] college dudes in long beach on spring break would like to  a pizza!.
